Choosing between Redux Toolkit and Zustand depends on the complexity of your project and your personal preference.

1. **Redux Toolkit**: It's a great choice for larger applications where you might need middleware support, devtools extension, and more complex state management. Redux Toolkit simplifies a lot of Redux's boilerplate and provides a set of tools that make it easier to write good Redux code. However, it can be overkill for simple state management needs.

2. **Zustand**: It's a smaller, simpler alternative to Redux. Zustand provides a minimal API but still allows you to manage global state. It's easier to set up and use, especially for smaller applications or for specific parts of your application where Redux might be too heavy.

In your case, since you're already using Zustand and your state management needs seem to be quite straightforward (based on the code you've shared), Zustand should be sufficient. However, if your application grows in complexity, you might want to consider switching to Redux Toolkit.

const updateTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number, text: string): Todo[] =>
todos.map((todo) => ({
...todo,
text: todo.id === id ? text : todo.text,
}));

This is a function signature in TypeScript. It describes a function that takes three parameters and returns an array of Todo objects.

Here's a breakdown:

todos: Todo[]: The first parameter is todos, which is an array of Todo objects.
id: number: The second parameter is id, which is a number. This is typically a unique identifier for a todo item.
text: string: The third parameter is text, which is a string. This is typically the new text that you want to set for a todo item.
: Todo[]: This after the parameter list indicates the return type of the function. In this case, the function returns an array of Todo objects.
However, this is just the signature. The actual implementation of the function would depend on what you want to do with these parameters. For example, if this is an updateTodo function, you might want to return a new array where the todo item with the given id has its text updated.

In this function, the map method is used to create a new array. For each todo item in the todos array, it checks if the id of the todo item matches the id parameter. If it does, it returns a new object with the same properties as the original todo item, but with the text property updated to the new text. If the id doesn't match, it returns the original todo item. This way, the function updates the specific todo item with the given id, and leaves all other todo items unchanged.

removeTodo
@ App.tsx:
const removeTodo = (id: number) => {
setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
};

passing it to TodoList component -
<TodoList todos={todos} removeTodo={removeTodo} />

@ TodoList.tsx -
interface TodoListItemsProps {
todos: Todo[];
removeTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

It is TodoListItems component @ TodoList.tsx that is rendering each todo item so need to pass the removeTodo function to this component as well then use it in the onClick of the Delete button to remove the particular item -
function TodoListItems({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListItemsProps) {
const theme = useTheme();

return (
<>
{todos.map((todo) => (
<Grid
container
spacing={3}
style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
          }}
key={todo.id} >
<Grid item xs={1}>
<Checkbox />
</Grid>
<Grid item xs={8}>
<TextField fullWidth value={todo.text} />
</Grid>
<Grid item xs={3}>
<Button variant="contained" fullWidth onClick={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}>
Delete
</Button>
</Grid>
</Grid>
))}
</>
);
}

function TodoList({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListItemsProps) {
return (
<>
<Typography variant="h4" className="listcss">

</Typography>
<TodoListItems todos={todos} removeTodo={removeTodo} />
</>
);
}

export default TodoList;

const removeTodo = (id: number) => { setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)); }; - seeking explanation wrt zustand store.ts as earlier you explained in terms of useState

Sure, let's break down the `removeTodo` function in the context of Zustand:

```typescript
const removeTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] =>
  todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id);
```

1. `const removeTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] => {...}`: This is the declaration of the `removeTodo` function. It takes two parameters, `todos` which is an array of `Todo` objects, and `id`, which is a number. This `id` is the identifier of the todo item that you want to remove. The function returns an array of `Todo` objects.

2. `todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)`: This is the body of the `removeTodo` function. It calls the `filter` function on the `todos` array.

3. `(todo) => todo.id !== id`: This is the function provided to the `filter` method. It takes a todo item and returns `true` if the todo's `id` is not equal to the `id` passed to `removeTodo`, and `false` otherwise. This means that the `filter` method will create a new array that doesn't include the todo with the `id` passed to `removeTodo`.

In the Zustand store, the `removeTodo` function is used like this:

```typescript
removeTodo: (id: number) => set((state) => ({ todos: removeTodo(state.todos, id) })),
```

Here, `set` is a function provided by Zustand that allows you to update the state. It's called with a function that takes the current state and returns the new state. The new state is an object that includes the updated `todos` array, which is obtained by calling the `removeTodo` function with the current `todos` array and the `id` of the todo to remove.

In summary, the `removeTodo` function removes the todo with the specified `id` from the `todos` array, and the `removeTodo` method in the Zustand store updates the `todos` state with the new array.

GitHub Copilot: Your Docker seems to be running correctly. The error you encountered earlier might be due to the Docker image `todo-zustand` not being available locally or remotely.

Here are the steps to resolve this:

1. Build the Docker image: Before running a Docker container, you need to build the Docker image. You can do this using the `docker build` command. You need a Dockerfile in your project directory for this. If you have a Dockerfile, you can build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t todo-zustand .
```

This command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as `todo-zustand`.

2. Run the Docker container: After building the image, you can run it using the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand
```

This command runs the `todo-zustand` Docker image in a new container. It also maps port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on the host machine.

If you don't have a Dockerfile, you need to create one. The Dockerfile contains instructions for building the Docker image. If you need help creating a Dockerfile, please provide more details about your application, such as the language and framework it's built with.

harihargithub: PS C:\Users\nhari\OneDrive\Documents\iitr gl apcifsd\React JS 3\zustand-yarn\todo-zustand> docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand
6736df20759ba63f15a25114f1ccece1059ec77563b0358936faf71b0c3ace1c

GitHub Copilot: Great! The long alphanumeric string `6736df20759ba63f15a25114f1ccece1059ec77563b0358936faf71b0c3ace1c` is the container ID for the Docker container that is now running your application.

You can verify that the container is running by using the `docker ps` command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all running Docker containers. You should see your `todo-zustand` container in the list.

Now, you should be able to access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

harihargithub: How to terminate the server

GitHub Copilot: To stop a running Docker container, you can use the `docker stop` command followed by either the container ID or the container name.

In your case, you provided the container ID in your previous message. So, you can stop the container by running:

```bash
docker stop 6736df20759ba63f15a25114f1ccece1059ec77563b0358936faf71b0c3ace1c
```

This command will stop the Docker container running your application, effectively terminating the server.

If you don't have the container ID, you can get a list of all running containers (along with their IDs) by using the `docker ps` command.

harihargithub: Possible to stop from Docker App?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can stop a running Docker container directly from the Docker Desktop application.

Here are the steps:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click on the "Dashboard" tab in the left-hand menu.
3. You will see a list of containers. Find the container you want to stop.
4. Click on the "Stop" button (it looks like a square) next to the container you want to stop.

This will stop the container, effectively terminating the server. If you want to start it again, you can do so by clicking the "Start" button (it looks like a triangle) next to the container.

harihargithub: This project which is easier and effective - with redux toolkit or zustand?

GitHub Copilot: Choosing between Redux Toolkit and Zustand depends on the complexity of your project and your personal preference.

1. **Redux Toolkit**: It's a great choice for larger applications where you might need middleware support, devtools extension, and more complex state management. Redux Toolkit simplifies a lot of Redux's boilerplate and provides a set of tools that make it easier to write good Redux code. However, it can be overkill for simple state management needs.

harihargithub: implementaion of all these functions in the active selection do be done in store.js itself?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, these functions can be implemented in the `store.ts` file itself. They can be used in the Zustand store to manipulate the state. Here's how you can create a Zustand store using these functions:

```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';

// Standard interface and functions
export interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  done: boolean;
}

const updateTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number, text: string): Todo[] =>
  todos.map((todo) => ({
    ...todo,
    text: todo.id === id ? text : todo.text,
  }));

const toggleTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] =>
  todos.map((todo) => ({
    ...todo,
    done: todo.id === id ? !todo.done : todo.done,
  }));

const removeTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] =>
  todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id);

const addTodo = (todos: Todo[], text: string): Todo[] => [
  ...todos,
  {
    id: Math.max(0, Math.max(...todos.map(({ id }) => id))) + 1,
    text,
    done: false,
  },
];

// Zustand store
export const useStore = create((set) => ({
  todos: [] as Todo[],
  addTodo: (text: string) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: addTodo(state.todos, text) })),
  updateTodo: (id: number, text: string) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: updateTodo(state.todos, id, text) })),
  toggleTodo: (id: number) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: toggleTodo(state.todos, id) })),
  removeTodo: (id: number) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: removeTodo(state.todos, id) })),
}));
```

In this code, `create` is a function from Zustand that creates a store. The `set` function is used to update the state. The `state` parameter represents the current state. The `todos` array in the state is updated by calling the corresponding function with the current `todos` array and the other parameters.

harihargithub: Parameter 'state' implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7006)
(parameter) state: any

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing is because TypeScript is expecting a type for the `state` parameter, but it's not provided.

You can define an interface for the state and use it to type the `state` parameter. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
interface State {
  todos: Todo[];
}

export const useStore = create<State>((set) => ({
  todos: [],
  addTodo: (text: string) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: addTodo(state.todos, text) })),
  updateTodo: (id: number, text: string) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: updateTodo(state.todos, id, text) })),
  toggleTodo: (id: number) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: toggleTodo(state.todos, id) })),
  removeTodo: (id: number) =>
    set((state) => ({ todos: removeTodo(state.todos, id) })),
}));
```

In this code, `State` is an interface that represents the state of the store. It's used to type the `state` parameter in the `set` function. This tells TypeScript that `state` is an object with a `todos` property that's an array of `Todo` objects.

harihargithub: @workspace /explain Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

```typescript
const updateTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number, text: string): Todo[] =>
  todos.map((todo) => ({
    ...todo,
    text: todo.id === id ? text : todo.text,
  }));
```

GitHub Copilot: The active selection is a function named `updateTodo` that is used to update a specific todo item in a list of todos. This function takes three parameters: `todos`, `id`, and `text`.

The `todos` parameter is an array of `Todo` objects. Each `Todo` object has an `id` (a number), `text` (a string), and `done` (a boolean indicating whether the todo is completed).

The `id` parameter is the identifier of the todo item that you want to update. The `text` parameter is the new text that you want to set for the todo item.

The function uses the `map` method to create a new array of todos. For each todo in the `todos` array, it checks if the `id` of the todo matches the `id` parameter. If it does, it returns a new object with the same properties as the original todo, but with the `text` property set to the `text` parameter. If the `id` of the todo doesn't match the `id` parameter, it returns the original todo.

This function is a pure function: it doesn't mutate the original `todos` array or the todo objects inside it. Instead, it returns a new array and new objects. This is a common pattern in React and Redux applications, and it helps prevent bugs and make the code easier to understand.

harihargithub: The todos parameter is an array of Todo objects. Each Todo object has an id (a number), text (a string), and done (a boolean indicating whether the todo is completed) - Please explain this further including the done usage..

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break it down:

A `Todo` object is defined by the `Todo` interface:

```typescript
export interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  done: boolean;
}
```

This interface specifies that a `Todo` object should have three properties:

1. `id`: A unique identifier for each todo item. This is typically used to track each todo item individually, for example, when you want to update or delete a specific todo item.

2. `text`: The actual content of the todo item. This is what the user inputs when they create a new todo item.

3. `done`: A boolean that indicates whether the todo item has been completed. If `done` is `true`, it means the todo item is completed. If `done` is `false`, it means the todo item is not completed.

The `done` property is typically used to toggle the completion status of a todo item. For example, in the `toggleTodo` function:

```typescript
const toggleTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] =>
  todos.map((todo) => ({
    ...todo,
    done: todo.id === id ? !todo.done : todo.done,
  }));
```

This function goes through each todo item in the `todos` array. If the `id` of a todo item matches the provided `id`, it toggles the `done` property of that todo item (if it was `true`, it becomes `false`, and vice versa). If the `id` doesn't match, it leaves the `done` property as is. This function is used to mark a todo item as completed or not completed.

harihargithub: const updateTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] - kindly explain this especially the expression used please

GitHub Copilot: The `updateTodo` function is a higher-order function that takes in two parameters: `todos` and `id`.

1. `todos`: This is an array of `Todo` objects. Each `Todo` object represents a todo item and has properties like `id`, `text`, and `done`.

2. `id`: This is a unique identifier for a todo item. It's used to find the specific todo item in the `todos` array that you want to update.

The function returns a new array of `Todo` objects.

However, the function definition seems to be incomplete. Typically, an `updateTodo` function would also take a third parameter, which is the new text or status for the todo item that you want to update.

Here's an example of a complete `updateTodo` function:

```typescript
const updateTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number, text: string): Todo[] =>
  todos.map((todo) => (todo.id === id ? { ...todo, text } : todo));
```

In this function, the `map` method is used to create a new array. For each todo item in the `todos` array, it checks if the `id` of the todo item matches the `id` parameter. If it does, it returns a new object with the same properties as the original todo item, but with the `text` property updated to the new text. If the `id` doesn't match, it returns the original todo item. This way, the function updates the specific todo item with the given `id`, and leaves all other todo items unchanged.

harihargithub: sorry for missing out text in my previous query -
(todos: Todo[], id: number, text: string): Todo[]

GitHub Copilot: This is a function signature in TypeScript. It describes a function that takes three parameters and returns an array of `Todo` objects.

Here's a breakdown:

- `todos: Todo[]`: The first parameter is `todos`, which is an array of `Todo` objects.
- `id: number`: The second parameter is `id`, which is a number. This is typically a unique identifier for a todo item.
- `text: string`: The third parameter is `text`, which is a string. This is typically the new text that you want to set for a todo item.
- `: Todo[]`: This after the parameter list indicates the return type of the function. In this case, the function returns an array of `Todo` objects.

However, this is just the signature. The actual implementation of the function would depend on what you want to do with these parameters. For example, if this is an `updateTodo` function, you might want to return a new array where the todo item with the given `id` has its `text` updated.

The global provider that must be added to make all Chakra components work correctly

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing suggests that TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of the `ChakraProvider` component from Chakra UI.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect TypeScript configuration**: Make sure your `tsconfig.json` file is correctly set up for a React project. Specifically, the `jsx` option should be set to `"react"`.

2. **Version mismatch**: There might be a version mismatch between your installed types for React and the actual React library, or between Chakra UI and its types. Make sure all your dependencies are up to date.

3. **Incorrect import**: Ensure that you're importing `ChakraProvider` correctly. The import statement you have seems correct, but it's worth double-checking.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to try deleting your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file (or `yarn.lock` if you're using Yarn), and then run `npm install` (or `yarn` if you're using Yarn) to reinstall your dependencies. This can sometimes fix issues caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

harihargithub: Please advise now

GitHub Copilot: Looking at your `package.json` file, it seems like your project is using TypeScript version `^3.9.5` and React version `^17.0.1`.

The Chakra UI library that you're using (`@chakra-ui/react` version `^1.0.0`) requires TypeScript version `^4.1.0` or later. This might be the reason why you're seeing the error.

To fix this, you can upgrade your TypeScript version to `^4.1.0` or later. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript@latest
```

This command will install the latest version of TypeScript in your project. After running this command, check your `package.json` file to make sure the TypeScript version is updated.

Then, try to compile your project again. If you're still seeing the error, you might need to restart your IDE or clear the TypeScript cache to make sure it's using the updated TypeScript version.

This can sometimes fix issues caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

harihargithub: Check this please

GitHub Copilot: Your `tsconfig.json` file seems to be correctly set up for a React project using TypeScript. The `"jsx": "react"` setting is correct for using JSX syntax in your TypeScript files.

However, the `"target": "es5"` setting might be causing issues with Chakra UI, which uses modern JavaScript features. You could try changing this to `"target": "es6"` or later.

Also, Chakra UI requires TypeScript version `^4.1.0` or later. Please ensure that your project is using a compatible TypeScript version. You can check this by looking at the `"devDependencies"` section in your `package.json` file, or by running `tsc --version` in your terminal.

If you're still having issues, it might be worth creating a new project with `create-react-app --template typescript` and then installing Chakra UI to see if the issue persists. This can help determine whether the issue is with your project configuration or with Chakra UI itself.

GitHub Copilot: The TypeScript version in your `package.json` file is `^5.3.3`. This version does not exist as the latest stable version of TypeScript at the time of writing is `4.5.2`.

Please update your TypeScript version to a valid one. If you want to use the latest stable version, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript@latest
```

After running this command, your `package.json` file should be updated with the correct TypeScript version. Then, try to compile your project again. If you're still seeing the error, you might need to restart your IDE or clear the TypeScript cache to make sure it's using the updated TypeScript version.

harihargithub: working in docker

GitHub Copilot: If you're working in a Docker environment and you want to update the TypeScript version, you'll need to rebuild your Docker image so that the changes in your `package.json` file are reflected in the Docker container.

Here are the steps:

1. Update the TypeScript version in your `package.json` file. You can do this manually by changing `"typescript": "^5.3.3"` to `"typescript": "^4.5.2"` (or whatever version you want to use).

2. Rebuild your Docker image. The command to do this will depend on how your Docker environment is set up, but it will generally look something like this:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

3. Once the image is rebuilt, you can run a new container with the updated image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 your-image-name
```

Remember to replace `your-image-name` with the actual name of your Docker image.

By rebuilding the image and running a new container, you ensure that the Docker environment has the updated TypeScript version.

harihargithub: src/App.tsx
Syntax error: DeprecationError: 'originalKeywordKind' has been deprecated since v5.0.0 and can no longer be used. Use 'identifierToKeywordKind(identifier)' instead (0:undefined)

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a deprecated usage of `originalKeywordKind` in your code or in one of your dependencies. This has been deprecated since version 5.0.0 and should be replaced with `identifierToKeywordKind(identifier)`.

However, this error is unusual for a TypeScript project and might be coming from a specific library or tool that you're using.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your code**: Make sure you're not using `originalKeywordKind` anywhere in your code.

2. **Update your dependencies**: Some of your dependencies might be using the deprecated `originalKeywordKind`. Updating them might solve the issue. You can update all your dependencies by running `npm update` in your terminal.

3. **Check your build tools**: If you're using a custom setup with Babel, Webpack, or another build tool, make sure they're all up to date and correctly configured. The error might be coming from one of these tools.

4. **Create a minimal reproduction**: If you're still having issues, try creating a new project with the same setup and see if the error persists. This can help you identify whether the issue is with your project configuration or with a specific piece of code.

harihargithub: Working on Docker

GitHub Copilot: If you're working in a Docker environment and you've updated the TypeScript version in your `package.json` file, you'll need to rebuild your Docker image to reflect these changes in your Docker container.

Here are the steps:

1. Save your changes in the `package.json` file.

2. Rebuild your Docker image. The command to do this will depend on how your Docker environment is set up, but it will generally look something like this:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

3. Once the image is rebuilt, you can run a new container with the updated image:

```bash

import ChakraProvider
The global provider that must be added to make all Chakra components work correctly

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing suggests that TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of the `ChakraProvider` component from Chakra UI.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect TypeScript configuration**: Make sure your `tsconfig.json` file is correctly set up for a React project. Specifically, the `jsx` option should be set to `"react"`.

2. **Version mismatch**: There might be a version mismatch between your installed types for React and the actual React library, or between Chakra UI and its types. Make sure all your dependencies are up to date.

3. **Incorrect import**: Ensure that you're importing `ChakraProvider` correctly. The import statement you have seems correct, but it's worth double-checking.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to try deleting your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file (or `yarn.lock` if you're using Yarn), and then run `npm install` (or `yarn` if you're using Yarn) to reinstall your dependencies. This can sometimes fix issues caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

harihargithub: npm install done and should I do yarn also

GitHub Copilot: No, you should not use both `npm` and `yarn` in the same project. They are both package managers, and using them interchangeably can lead to inconsistencies and errors in your project.

If you've already run `npm install`, there's no need to run `yarn` as well. The `npm install` command should have installed all the necessary dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

If you're still seeing the error with `ChakraProvider`, it might be worth checking the versions of `@chakra-ui/react` and `@emotion/react` in your `package.json` file. Chakra UI v1 depends on Emotion 11, so if you have a different version of Emotion installed, it might be causing issues.

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing is related to the `postcss` package. It seems like there's an issue with the way it's being imported in the `postcss-safe-parser` package.

This issue is often caused by a version mismatch between different packages. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update your dependencies**: Run `npm update` to update all your dependencies to their latest versions. This might resolve the issue if it's caused by a version mismatch.

2. **Delete `node_modules` and reinstall**: Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` to reinstall your dependencies. This can sometimes fix issues caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

3. **Downgrade Node.js**: The error message suggests that you're using Node.js v20.8.1. This is a very recent version and might not be fully compatible with all your dependencies. Consider downgrading to a more stable version, like Node.js v14 or v16.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes to ensure they're properly applied.

Node.js v20.8.1

- earlier was working on yarn with docker

GitHub Copilot: The error you're seeing is related to the version of Node.js you're using. Node.js v20.8.1 is a very recent version and might not be fully compatible with all your dependencies.

The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `crypto` module, which is a built-in Node.js module. This module is likely used by one of your dependencies, and the version of Node.js you're using does not support the specific cryptographic function that's being called.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Downgrade Node.js**: Downgrade to a more stable version of Node.js, like v14 or v16. You can do this using a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager). Here's how you can install it and use it to install Node.js v14:

   ```bash
   nvm install 14
   nvm use 14
   ```

2. **Delete `node_modules` and reinstall**: Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` to reinstall your dependencies. This can sometimes fix issues caused by corrupted or outdated dependencies.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes to ensure they're properly applied.

harihargithub: nvm 14 will not affect other projects, right?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, using `nvm` to switch to Node.js version 14 will not affect your other projects.

`nvm` allows you to switch between different versions of Node.js on a per-project basis. When you use the `nvm use 14` command, it only sets the Node.js version for the current terminal session.

If you want to use Node.js version 14 for a specific project, you can navigate to that project's directory in your terminal and run `nvm use 14`. For other projects, you can use a different version of Node.js by running `nvm use` with the desired version number.

If you want to set a default Node.js version to be used in any new terminal session, you can use the `nvm alias default` command. For example, `nvm alias default 14` will set Node.js version 14 as the default version.

harihargithub: PS C:\Users\nhari\OneDrive\Documents\iitr gl apcifsd\React JS 3\zustand-yarn\todo-zustand> nvm install 14

  ```

GitHub Copilot: It seems like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) is not installed on your system.

If you're using Windows, you should install `nvm-windows`, a slightly different version of `nvm` that is designed for Windows systems. Here's how you can install it:

1. Download the latest version of `nvm-windows` from the [releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) on GitHub. You should download the `nvm-setup.zip` file.

2. Extract the zip file and run the `nvm-setup.exe` file to install `nvm-windows`.

3. Once the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run `nvm -v` to verify that `nvm` was installed correctly. You should see the version of `nvm` printed to the console.

4. Now you can install Node.js v14 by running `nvm install 14`.

5. To use Node.js v14, run `nvm use 14`.

Remember to restart your terminal after installing `nvm-windows` to ensure that the `nvm` command is available.

harihargithub: how about in docker

GitHub Copilot: If you want to run your application in a Docker container, you'll need to create a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Here's a basic example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the application's dependencies inside the Docker image
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application's code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Make port 3000 available outside the container
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

You can build the Docker image by running `docker build -t todo-zustand .` in your terminal. This command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile and tags it as `todo-zustand`.

After the image is built, you can run your application in a Docker container with the command `docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand`. This command starts a new container and maps port 3000 inside the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

Remember to replace `node:14` with the version of Node.js that your application requires.

harihargithub: docker error -
src/App.tsx
Syntax error: DeprecationError: 'originalKeywordKind' has been deprecated since v5.0.0 and can no longer be used. Use 'identifierToKeywordKind(identifier)' instead (0:undefined)

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing is likely due to a version mismatch between the TypeScript compiler and the Babel plugin that's being used to transpile your TypeScript code.

The `originalKeywordKind` property has been deprecated in TypeScript 4.4 and removed in TypeScript 4.5. If you're using a version of `@babel/preset-typescript` or `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` that doesn't support TypeScript 4.5, you might see this error.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update your Babel packages**: Run `npm update @babel/preset-typescript @babel/plugin-transform-typescript` to update these packages to their latest versions. This might resolve the issue if it's caused by a version mismatch.

2. **Downgrade TypeScript**: If updating your Babel packages doesn't resolve the issue, you might need to downgrade TypeScript to a version that's compatible with your Babel packages. You can do this by running `npm install typescript@4.4`.

Remember to rebuild your Docker image after making these changes to ensure they're properly applied.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes to ensure they're properly applied.

harihargithub: reinstall - npm install -g yarn - is it right?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. The command `npm install -g yarn` will install Yarn globally on your system.

The `-g` flag in the command tells npm to install the package globally, which means it will be available to all projects on your system.

If you've previously installed Yarn and are experiencing issues, reinstalling it with this command can help resolve those issues.

Remember to run your terminal or command prompt as an administrator (or use `sudo` on Linux or macOS) when installing global packages to avoid permission issues.

harihargithub: PS C:\Users\nhari\OneDrive\Documents\iitr gl apcifsd\React JS 3\zustand-yarn\todo-zustand> npm install -g yarn

changed 1 package in 2s

    - not getting fully installed

GitHub Copilot: The output `changed 1 package in 2s` typically indicates that the installation was successful. However, if you're not sure, you can verify the installation by checking the version of Yarn. You can do this by running the command `yarn --version` in your terminal. If Yarn is installed correctly, this command should print the version of Yarn to the console.

If you're still having issues, it might be a problem with your npm configuration or a network issue. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache. The npm cache can sometimes cause issues with installing packages.

2. **Check your network connection**: If you're on a slow or unreliable network connection, it might be causing issues with installing packages. If possible, try switching to a different network and see if that resolves the issue.

3. **Reinstall npm and Node.js**: If all else fails, you might need to reinstall npm and Node.js. You can do this by downloading the latest stable version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js, so reinstalling Node.js will also reinstall npm.

harihargithub: 1.22.21  
 but nodes_module & package-lock not seen

GitHub Copilot: The `npm install -g yarn` command installs Yarn globally on your system, not in your project directory. Therefore, it doesn't create a `node_modules` directory or a `package-lock.json` file in your project directory.

If you want to install the dependencies for your project, you should navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run `yarn` or `yarn install`. This will read the `package.json` file in your project directory, install the necessary dependencies, and create a `node_modules` directory and a `yarn.lock` file.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
yarn
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory. After running these commands, you should see a `node_modules` directory and a `yarn.lock` file in your project directory.

harihargithub: noted and so yarn installation locally in the project directory not required, right?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, once Yarn is installed globally on your system, you do not need to install it again in your project directory.

You can use Yarn to manage your project's dependencies by running Yarn commands in your project directory. For example, you can install a package with `yarn add package-name`, or install all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file with `yarn` or `yarn install`.

Remember, when you install packages in your project using Yarn, it will create a `node_modules` directory and a `yarn.lock` file in your project directory. The `node_modules` directory is where the installed packages are stored, and the `yarn.lock` file is used to lock down the versions of the installed packages.

harihargithub: next can I perform -
docker build -t todo-zustand .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can run those commands to build and run your Docker image.

Here's what each command does:

1. `docker build -t todo-zustand .`: This command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`) and tags it as `todo-zustand`.

2. `docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand`: This command runs a container from the `todo-zustand` image in detached mode (`-d`). The `-p 3000:3000` option maps port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

Before running these commands, make sure you're in the directory that contains your Dockerfile. Also, ensure that Docker is running on your machine. If you're using Docker Desktop, you can check this by looking at the Docker icon in your system tray or menu bar. If the icon is green, Docker is running.

harihargithub: Cannot find module '@chakra-ui/react' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)  
 - please fix or advise alternate

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing indicates that TypeScript cannot find the `@chakra-ui/react` module. This could be because the module is not installed, or because the type declarations for the module are missing.

Here's how you can fix this issue:

1. **Install the module**: Run `yarn add @chakra-ui/react` to install the `@chakra-ui/react` module. This command will add the module to your `node_modules` directory and update your `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files.

2. **Install the type declarations**: The `@chakra-ui/react` module should come with its own type declarations, so you shouldn't need to install them separately. However, if you're still seeing the error after installing the module, you can try installing the type declarations with `yarn add @types/chakra-ui__react`. Note that not all npm packages have types available in the `@types` organization.

After running these commands, restart your development server to ensure the changes are properly applied. If you're still seeing the error, you might need to check your TypeScript configuration to ensure it's correctly set up to use modules.

harihargithub: chakra installed and errors gone and now should I perform these again -
docker build -t todo-zustand .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand

GitHub Copilot: Yes, now that you've resolved the errors and installed the necessary dependencies, you should rebuild your Docker image and run it again.

Here's what each command does:

1. `docker build -t todo-zustand .`: This command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`) and tags it as `todo-zustand`.

2. `docker run -p 3000:3000 -d todo-zustand`: This command runs a container from the `todo-zustand` image in detached mode (`-d`). The `-p 3000:3000` option maps port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on your host machine.

Remember to run these commands in the terminal from the directory that contains your Dockerfile.

harihargithub: error - Looks like this page doesn't have React, or it hasn't been loaded yet.

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing suggests that React is either not installed or not being imported correctly in your project.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your React import**: At the top of your `App.tsx` file, you should have a line that looks like this: `import React from 'react';`. If this line is missing, add it to the top of your file.

2. **Install React**: If React is not installed, you can install it with Yarn by running `yarn add react react-dom`.

3. **Check your React version**: If you're using a version of React that's not compatible with your other dependencies, you might see this error. Check your `package.json` file to see which version of React you're using. If you're using a very old or very new version, consider switching to a more stable version.

4. **Check your script tags**: If you're using React in a HTML file, make sure you're including the correct script tags in the correct order. You should include `react.js` before `react-dom.js`, and both of them should be included before your own script file.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes to ensure they're properly applied. If you're still seeing the error, there might be an issue with your build configuration or your use of React.

harihargithub: Please check

GitHub Copilot: The code you've shared is a typical React component written in TypeScript. It imports necessary modules and components from `react`, `@chakra-ui/react`, and local component files. Then it defines and exports a functional component named `App`.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `import * as React from 'react';`: This imports the React library.

2. `import { ChakraProvider, Box, theme } from '@chakra-ui/react';`: This imports the `ChakraProvider`, `Box`, and `theme` from the Chakra UI library, which is a popular UI library for React.

3. `import TopBar from './components/TopBar';`, `import TodoList from './components/TodoList';`, and `import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';`: These lines import local components that are defined in your project.

4. `export function App() {...}`: This defines a functional component named `App`. This component uses the `ChakraProvider` to provide theme context to its children. Inside the `Box` component, it renders the `TopBar`, `TodoList`, and `TodoAdd` components.

If you're seeing an error message about React not being loaded, it could be due to a misconfiguration in your project setup. The code you've shared seems correct, so the issue might be elsewhere in your project.

Make sure that React is installed in your project by checking your `package.json` file or running `yarn list react`. If it's not installed, you can add it with `yarn add react react-dom`.

Also, ensure that your TypeScript configuration (usually in a `tsconfig.json` file) is set up correctly for a React project. For example, you should have `"jsx": "react"` in your `compilerOptions`.

2023-12-10 08:47:14 Can't import the named export 'AnimatePresence' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests two issues:

1. The `babel-preset-react-app` package is using `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` without declaring it as a dependency. To fix this, you can add `@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object` to your project's devDependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add --dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
```

2. The second error is related to ES Modules. It seems like your project is trying to import a named export from a CommonJS module, which is not allowed. This could be due to a misconfiguration in your project or a problem with the `@chakra-ui/transition` package.

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

- Ensure that your project is set up to use ES Modules. In your `tsconfig.json` file, you should have `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "node"`, which you already have.

- Update your dependencies. Sometimes these kinds of issues can be fixed by updating to the latest versions of your dependencies. You can update all your dependencies by running `yarn upgrade`.

- If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the `@chakra-ui/transition` package itself. In that case, you might need to reach out to the maintainers of the package for help.

harihargithub: Kindly check and advise on ES please

GitHub Copilot: Your `tsconfig.json` file seems to be correctly configured for a typical React project using TypeScript. The `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "node"` options are correctly set for ES Modules.

However, the error you're encountering is related to the way modules are being imported or exported in your project or one of your dependencies. It's not directly related to the TypeScript configuration.

The error message suggests that a named export is being imported from a module that only supports default exports. This is usually a problem with the way the module itself is written or compiled, not with your project's configuration.

Here's what you can do:

1. **Update your dependencies**: Run `yarn upgrade` to update all your dependencies to their latest versions. This might fix the issue if it's been resolved in a newer version of the problematic module.

2. **Check the problematic module**: The error message should specify which module is causing the problem. Check the documentation for that module to see if there are any known issues or special instructions for using it with TypeScript or ES Modules.

3. **Contact the module maintainers**: If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the module itself. Consider opening an issue on the module's GitHub repository or other support channel.

Remember to restart your development server after making any changes to your `tsconfig.json` file or `node_modules` directory to ensure the changes are properly applied.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that the `@chakra-ui/transition` package is trying to import a named export `AnimatePresence` from a non-ECMAScript module, which is not allowed.

This issue might be due to the way the `@chakra-ui/transition` package is compiled or a misconfiguration in your project.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update your dependencies**: Run `yarn upgrade` to update all your dependencies to their latest versions. This might fix the issue if it's been resolved in a newer version of the problematic module.

2. **Check the problematic module**: The error message should specify which module is causing the problem. Check the documentation for that module to see if there are any known issues or special instructions for using it with TypeScript or ES Modules.

3. **Contact the module maintainers**: If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the module itself. Consider opening an issue on the module's GitHub repository or other support channel.

4. **Webpack configuration**: If you're using Webpack, you might need to add a configuration to handle `.mjs` files. In your `webpack.config.js`, you can add the following rule:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.mjs$/,
        include: /node_modules/,
        type: 'javascript/auto',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This tells Webpack to treat `.mjs` files as regular JavaScript, which might resolve the import issue.

Remember to restart your development server after making any changes to your `tsconfig.json` file or `node_modules` directory to ensure the changes are properly applied.

harihargithub: working on docker

GitHub Copilot: The `tsconfig.json` file you've shared is correctly configured for a typical React project using TypeScript. The `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "node"` options are correctly set for ES Modules.

However, if you're still encountering the error with `@chakra-ui/transition` package while running your application in a Docker container, it might be due to the way your Docker image is being built.

Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Rebuild your Docker image**: After making changes to your project or updating your dependencies, you should rebuild your Docker image to ensure it includes the latest changes. You can do this with the `docker build -t todo-zustand .` command you've been using.

2. **Check your Dockerfile**: Make sure your Dockerfile is correctly set up to install your project's dependencies and build your project. For a typical Node.js project, your Dockerfile might look something like this:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the project files to the working directory
COPY . .

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

3. **Clear Docker cache**: Docker caches the results of each step in your Dockerfile to speed up subsequent builds. However, this can sometimes cause problems if a cached step is no longer valid due to changes in your project. You can force Docker to ignore the cache and rebuild everything from scratch with the `--no-cache` option: `docker build --no-cache -t todo-zustand .`.

Remember to replace `npm` commands with `yarn` if you're using Yarn as your package manager.

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing indicates that the port 3000 on your machine is already in use by another process. Docker is trying to bind the container's port 3000 to your machine's port 3000, but it can't because that port is already occupied.

Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:

1. **Stop the process that's using port 3000**: If you know which process is using port 3000, you can stop it to free up the port. If you're not sure, you can use tools like `lsof` on macOS/Linux or `netstat` on Windows to find out.

2. **Use a different port**: If you can't stop the process that's using port 3000, or if you need to keep that port open for another reason, you can bind the container's port 3000 to a different port on your machine. For example, to use port 3001 instead, you would run `docker run -p 3001:3000 -d todo-zustand`. Then you can access your app at `http://localhost:3001`.

3. **Stop and remove all Docker containers**: If you're not sure which process is using port 3000, and you don't have any other Docker containers running that you need to keep, you can stop and remove all Docker containers to ensure that none of them are using port 3000. Be careful with this option, as it will stop and remove all your Docker containers, not just the one you're trying to run. Here's the command to stop and remove all Docker containers:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

After running one of these solutions, try running your `docker run` command again. It should be able to bind to port 3000 successfully.

  The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version. + CategoryInfo : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidEndOfLine

GitHub Copilot: The error you're seeing is because the command you're trying to run uses syntax that's specific to Unix-like shells (like Bash), but you're running it in PowerShell, which has a different syntax.

In PowerShell, you can use the semicolon (`;`) as a command separator instead of `&&`. Here's how you can stop and remove all Docker containers in PowerShell:

```powershell
docker stop $(docker ps -aq); docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

This command does the same thing as the one you were trying to run: it stops all running Docker containers and then removes them. Be careful when running this command, as it will stop and remove all your Docker containers, not just the one you're trying to run.

GitHub Copilot: The error you're encountering is a known issue with some packages when using Webpack 5, which is used by Create React App v4. The issue arises when trying to import a named export from a `.mjs` file, which is not allowed.

A workaround for this issue is to add a package named `react-app-rewired` and `babel-plugin-transform-node-imports` to your project, which allows you to customize the Webpack configuration without ejecting from Create React App.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Install `react-app-rewired` and `babel-plugin-transform-node-imports`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired babel-plugin-transform-node-imports
```

2. Create a `config-overrides.js` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = function override(webpackConfig) {
  webpackConfig.module.rules.push({
    test: /\.mjs$/,
    include: /node_modules/,
    type: 'javascript/auto',
  });

  return webpackConfig;
};
```

3. Replace `react-scripts` with `react-app-rewired` in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-app-rewired start",
  "build": "react-app-rewired build",
  "test": "react-app-rewired test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

4. Rebuild your Docker image and run it again.

This should resolve the issue with importing named exports from `.mjs` files.

harihargithub: please check now and advise please

GitHub Copilot: Your Dockerfile seems to be correctly set up to install your project's dependencies. However, the error message `sh: 1: react-app-rewired: not found` indicates that the `react-app-rewired` package is not found in your Docker container.

This could be because the package was not installed correctly or not included in the Docker image. It could also be due to the `NODE_ENV` environment variable being set to `production`, which causes npm to not install packages listed in `devDependencies`.

Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Move `react-app-rewired` to `dependencies`**: Since your Docker environment is set to `production`, npm will not install `devDependencies`. If `react-app-rewired` is listed in `devDependencies`, move it to `dependencies` in your `package.json` file.

2. **Rebuild your Docker image**: After making changes to your `package.json` file, you should rebuild your Docker image to ensure it includes the latest changes. You can do this with the `docker build -t todo-zustand .` command you've been using.

After following these steps, try running your Docker container again. It should be able to find the `react-app-rewired` package and start your app successfully.

harihargithub: check now and advise the changes to be made please

GitHub Copilot: From the provided `package.json` file, it seems that `react-app-rewired` is not listed in either the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` sections. This is likely the reason why the Docker container is unable to find the `react-app-rewired` command.

To resolve this issue, you should add `react-app-rewired` to your `dependencies` section. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add `react-app-rewired` to your `dependencies`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "react-app-rewired": "^2.1.8",
  ...
},
```

2. After making this change, rebuild your Docker image to ensure it includes the updated `package.json` file.

3. Run your Docker container again. It should now be able to find the `react-app-rewired` package and start your app successfully.

Please note that the version number `^2.1.8` is just an example. You should use the latest version of `react-app-rewired` that is compatible with your project. You can find the latest version on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired).

harihargithub: is it right now?

GitHub Copilot: The `react-app-rewired` package is currently listed in the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json` file. This is generally fine for development environments, but it can cause issues in production environments, as npm does not install `devDependencies` when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.

Since your Docker environment is likely set to `production`, you should move `react-app-rewired` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`. Here's how your `package.json` file should look:

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the JavaScript optional chaining operator (`?.`) is being used in your code, but the environment doesn't support it. This operator is relatively new to JavaScript and is not supported in older environments.

The `react-scripts` package, which is used to build your application, includes a version of Babel that should transpile this syntax into something that can be understood by older environments. However, it seems like this isn't happening for the `@zag-js/dom-query` package.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Upgrade `react-scripts`**: If you're not using the latest version of `react-scripts`, upgrading might solve the problem. The latest version may include a newer version of Babel that can handle the optional chaining operator.

2. **Configure Babel to transpile `node_modules`**: By default, `react-scripts` doesn't transpile files in `node_modules`. You can override this behavior by ejecting from `create-react-app` and modifying the Babel configuration, but this is generally not recommended because it makes your setup more complex and harder to maintain.

3. **Replace the problematic package**: If the `@zag-js/dom-query` package is not essential to your project, you could consider replacing it with another package that provides similar functionality but doesn't use the optional chaining operator.

4. **Contact the package maintainer**: If none of the above solutions are feasible, you could contact the maintainer of the `@zag-js/dom-query` package and ask them to transpile their code to a version of JavaScript that's compatible with more environments.

Node.js v20.8.1
error Command failed with exit code 1.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported` is typically caused by a mismatch between the version of Node.js and the version of the `react-scripts` package in your project.

You're currently using Node.js v20.8.1, which is a very recent version. The `react-scripts` package in your project is version 4.0.2, which may not be fully compatible with this version of Node.js.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Node.js**: You could downgrade to an earlier version of Node.js that is known to be compatible with `react-scripts` 4.0.2. The LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js is usually a safe choice.

2. **Upgrade `react-scripts`**: Alternatively, you could try upgrading to the latest version of `react-scripts`, which might be compatible with Node.js v20.8.1. However, this could potentially introduce other compatibility issues with your project.

3. **Use a Node Version Manager**: Tools like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) or `n` allow you to easily switch between different versions of Node.js. This can be helpful if you're working on multiple projects that require different Node.js versions.

Remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your packages after changing your Node.js version or upgrading `react-scripts`. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct Node.js version.

harihargithub: How to change Node.js?

GitHub Copilot: To change the Node.js version, you can use a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) or `n`. Here's how you can do it with `nvm`:

1. **Install `nvm`**: You can download `nvm` from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). Follow the instructions in the README to install it.

2. **Install a specific version of Node.js**: Once `nvm` is installed, you can install a specific version of Node.js by running `nvm install <version>`. For example, to install Node.js 14.17.0, you would run `nvm install 14.17.0`.

3. **Use the installed version**: After installing a version of Node.js, you can switch to it by running `nvm use <version>`. For example, to switch to Node.js 14.17.0, you would run `nvm use 14.17.0`.

4. **Verify the change**: You can verify that you're using the correct version of Node.js by running `node -v`. This should print the version number that you selected.

Remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your packages after changing your Node.js version. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct Node.js version.

harihargithub: I am in github page referred by you and please advise how to access down of v14..

GitHub Copilot: To download Node.js version 14 using `nvm` (Node Version Manager), follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. If you have `nvm` installed, you can install Node.js version 14 by running the following command:

```bash
nvm install 14
```

3. After the installation is complete, you can switch to the newly installed version by running:

```bash
nvm use 14
```

4. Verify that the correct version is being used by running:

```bash
node -v
```

This should print `v14.x.x`, where `x.x` is the latest patch version of Node.js 14.

Remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your packages after changing your Node.js version. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct Node.js version.

harihargithub: how to check if nvm installed?

GitHub Copilot: You can check if `nvm` (Node Version Manager) is installed by opening your terminal and typing the following command:

```bash
nvm use 14
```

Once you've switched to the correct version of Node.js, you should delete your `node_modules` directory and your `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` to reinstall your packages. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct version of Node.js.

harihargithub: how to check installation done?

GitHub Copilot: You can check if Node.js is installed and which version is currently in use by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will print the version of Node.js that's currently active on your system.

To check if `nvm-windows` is installed and which version is currently in use, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nvm version

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing indicates that `nvm` is not recognized as a command. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. `nvm-windows` is not installed correctly.
2. The system's PATH environment variable does not include the directory where `nvm-windows` is installed.

To resolve this issue, you can try reinstalling `nvm-windows`:

1. Uninstall `nvm-windows` if it's already installed.
2. Download the latest `nvm-setup.zip` file from the [`nvm-windows` releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
3. Extract the `nvm-setup.zip` file and run the `nvm-setup.exe` file to install `nvm-windows`.
4. After the installation is complete, open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and try running `nvm version` again.

If you're still having trouble, you might need to manually add `nvm-windows` to your system's PATH. This process can vary depending on your system's configuration, but generally involves editing the system or user environment variables.

Also, please note that the Node.js version you're currently using (v20.8.1) is not a valid Node.js version. The latest LTS version of Node.js at the time of writing is v14.18.1, and the latest current version is v17.0.1. You might want to install a stable version of Node.js once you have `nvm-windows` working.

harihargithub: C:\Program Files\nodejs will be overwritten and all contents will be
lost. Do you want to proceed?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you should proceed. This message is indicating that the Node.js installation in the directory `C:\Program Files\nodejs` will be replaced. This is expected when you're installing a new version of Node.js or reinstalling Node.js.

Please note that this will only affect the Node.js installation itself. It won't affect your global npm packages, which are stored in a different location (`%AppData%\npm` on Windows), or your project's local npm packages, which are stored in the `node_modules` directory in your project's root directory.

However, if you have any custom configurations or files in the `C:\Program Files\nodejs` directory that you want to keep, you should back them up before proceeding.

harihargithub: Completing the NVM for
Windows Setup Wizard

Setup has finished installing NVM for Windows on your
computer. The application may be launched by selecting the
installed shortcuts.

Click Finish to exit Setup.

GitHub Copilot: Great! Now that `nvm-windows` is installed, you can manage your Node.js versions.

To install a specific version of Node.js, you can use the `nvm install` command followed by the version number. For example, to install Node.js version 14, you would run:

```bash
nvm install 14
```

After installing a new version of Node.js, you can switch to it using the `nvm use` command followed by the version number. For example, to switch to Node.js version 14, you would run:

```bash
nvm use 14
```

Once you've switched to the correct version of Node.js, you should delete your `node_modules` directory and your `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` to reinstall your packages. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct version of Node.js.

'nvm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing indicates that `nvm` is not recognized as a command. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. `nvm-windows` is not installed correctly.
2. The system's PATH environment variable does not include the directory where `nvm-windows` is installed.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Close and reopen your terminal. Sometimes, changes to the system's PATH don't take effect until a new terminal session is started.

2. Check if `nvm-windows` is installed in the correct directory. By default, `nvm-windows` is installed in `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\nvm`. If it's not there, you might need to reinstall `nvm-windows`.

3. Check if your system's PATH includes the directory where `nvm-windows` is installed. You can do this by running `echo %PATH%` in your terminal. If the output doesn't include the `nvm-windows` directory, you'll need to add it to your PATH.

4. If you're still having trouble, you might need to reinstall `nvm-windows`. Uninstall `nvm-windows` if it's already installed, then download the latest `nvm-setup.zip` file from the [`nvm-windows` releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases), extract the `nvm-setup.zip` file, and run the `nvm-setup.exe` file to install `nvm-windows`. After the installation is complete, open a new terminal window and try running `nvm version` again.

Now that you've switched to the correct version of Node.js, you should delete your `node_modules` directory and your `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` to reinstall your packages. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct version of Node.js.

Here are the commands to do this:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

After running these commands, you should be able to run your project without any Node.js version issues.

harihargithub: using yarn here

GitHub Copilot: If you're using Yarn as your package manager, you should delete the `node_modules` directory and the `yarn.lock` file, then run `yarn` to reinstall your packages. This ensures that all native addons are compiled against the correct version of Node.js.

Here are the commands to do this:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock

./node_modules/@chakra-ui/transition/dist/chunk-RKXMPHPI.mjs

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `@chakra-ui/transition` package, which is a part of the Chakra UI library. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package might not be compatible with the current version of Node.js that you're using.
2. The package might not be installed correctly.
3. The package might have dependencies that are not installed.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Reinstall the `@chakra-ui/transition` package. You can do this by running `yarn remove @chakra-ui/transition` followed by `yarn add @chakra-ui/transition`.

2. If the `@chakra-ui/transition` package is a dependency of another package, try reinstalling that package.

3. If you're using a version of Node.js that's not compatible with the `@chakra-ui/transition` package, try switching to a different version of Node.js. You can use `nvm` to switch between Node.js versions.

4. If none of the above solutions work, there might be an issue with the `@chakra-ui/transition` package itself. In this case, you might want to consider using a different package or library that provides similar functionality.

./node_modules/@chakra-ui/transition/dist/chunk-RKXMPHPI.mjs
Can't import the named export 'AnimatePresence' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing is related to how ES Modules (ESM) and CommonJS modules are handled in Node.js and Webpack.

The `@chakra-ui/transition` package is using ESM, and it's trying to import a named export from a CommonJS module, which is not allowed. Only default exports can be imported from CommonJS modules in ESM.

To fix this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

1. **Use Babel to transpile your dependencies:** You can use Babel to transpile your dependencies to CommonJS before Webpack bundles your code. To do this, you'll need to modify your Babel and Webpack configurations. Here's an example of how you can do this:

   ```javascript
   // babel.config.js
   module.exports = {
     presets: [
       ['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { node: 'current' } }],
       '@babel/preset-react',
     ],
     ignore: ['node_modules'],
   };
   ```

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   module.exports = {
     // ...
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.m?js$/,
           exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
           use: {
             loader: 'babel-loader',
             options: {
               presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
             },
           },
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Use the `react-app-rewired` package to override the Webpack configuration:** Since you're using `create-react-app`, you can't modify the Webpack configuration directly. However, you can use the `react-app-rewired` package to override the Webpack configuration. Here's an example of how you can do this:

   ```javascript
   // config-overrides.js
   module.exports = function override(config, env) {
     // Allow importing from node_modules
     config.module.rules[0].include = undefined;
     config.module.rules[0].exclude = /webpackHotDevClient/;

     return config;
   };
   ```

Please note that these solutions might not work in all cases, and they might require additional configuration depending on your project's setup. If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider using a different library that doesn't use ESM, or you might want to eject from `create-react-app` so you can configure Webpack directly.

harihargithub: if issue with chakra can you advise alternative to chakra

GitHub Copilot: Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.

harihargithub: if the issue noticed here is with chakra please advise alternate

GitHub Copilot: If you're looking for an alternative to Chakra UI, there are several other popular UI libraries for React that you might consider:

1. **Material-UI:** This is a popular UI framework that implements the Material Design guidelines from Google. It provides a wide range of pre-designed components that you can use in your project.

   To use Material-UI, you would first need to install it:

   ```bash
   yarn add @material-ui/core
   ```

   Then, you can import and use the components in your code:

   ```jsx
   import { Box, ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
   import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
   import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
   import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

   const theme = createMuiTheme();

   export function App() {
     return (
       <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
         <Box maxWidth="8xl" margin="auto" p={5}>
           <TopBar />
           <TodoList />
           <TodoAdd />
         </Box>
       </ThemeProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Ant Design:** This is another popular UI framework that provides a wide range of pre-designed components. It's known for its enterprise-level components and good internationalization support.

   To use Ant Design, you would first need to install it:

   ```bash
   yarn add antd
   ```

   Then, you can import and use the components in your code:

   ```jsx
   import { Layout } from 'antd';
   import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
   import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
   import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

   const { Content } = Layout;

   export function App() {
     return (
       <Layout>
         <Content style={{ maxWidth: '8xl', margin: 'auto', padding: '5px' }}>
           <TopBar />
           <TodoList />
           <TodoAdd />
         </Content>
       </Layout>
     );
   }
   ```

Please note that you'll need to update your `TopBar`, `TodoList`, and `TodoAdd` components to use the components from the new UI library.

harihargithub: Please advise the changes here

GitHub Copilot: The code you've shared is using Chakra UI's `Grid` component for layout and `Button` component from Material-UI. If you're switching to Material-UI completely, you would need to replace the `Grid` component with a similar one from Material-UI.

Here's how you can modify your `TopBar` component to use Material-UI's `Grid` and `Button` components:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, Grid } from '@material-ui/core';
import { ColorModeSwitcher } from './ColorModeSwitcher';

/*
JSON source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jherr/todos-four-ways/master/data/todos.json
*/

function TopBar() {
  return (
    <Grid container spacing={3} style={{ paddingTop: '16px' }}>
      <Grid item xs={6}>
        <ColorModeSwitcher />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={6}>
        <Button variant="contained">Load</Button>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
}

export default TopBar;
```

In this code:

- The `Grid` component with `container` prop is used to create a container.
- The `spacing` prop on the `Grid` container is used to create space between the grid items (similar to `columnGap` in Chakra UI).
- The `style` prop is used to add top padding to the `Grid` container (similar to `pt` in Chakra UI).
- The `Grid` component with `item` prop is used to create grid items.
- The `xs` prop on the `Grid` items is used to specify the grid item's width on extra small screens (similar to `templateColumns` in Chakra UI).
- The `variant="contained"` prop is added to the `Button` component to give it a filled style.

Please note that you'll need to update the `ColorModeSwitcher` component to use Material-UI if it's currently using Chakra UI.

harihargithub: Advise here too please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can modify your `TodoAdd` component to use Material-UI's `Grid`, `TextField`, and `Button` components:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, TextField, Grid } from '@material-ui/core';

function TodoAdd() {
  return (
    <Grid container spacing={3} style={{ paddingTop: '16px' }}>
      <Grid item xs={10}>
        <TextField fullWidth placeholder="New todo" />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={2}>
        <Button variant="contained" fullWidth>
          Add Todo
        </Button>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
}

export default TodoAdd;
```

In this code:

- The `Grid` component with `container` prop is used to create a container.
- The `spacing` prop on the `Grid` container is used to create space between the grid items (similar to `columnGap` in Chakra UI).
- The `style` prop is used to add top padding to the `Grid` container (similar to `pt` in Chakra UI).
- The `Grid` component with `item` prop is used to create grid items.
- The `xs` prop on the `Grid` items is used to specify the grid item's width on extra small screens (similar to `templateColumns` in Chakra UI).
- The `TextField` component is used instead of the `Input` component. The `fullWidth` prop is added to make it take up the full width of the grid item.
- The `variant="contained"` prop is added to the `Button` component to give it a filled style. The `fullWidth` prop is added to make it take up the full width of the grid item.

harihargithub: this one too please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can modify your `TodoList` component to use Material-UI's `Typography`, `Grid`, `Checkbox`, `TextField`, and `Button` components:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  Button,
  TextField,
  Checkbox,
  Typography,
  Grid,
} from '@material-ui/core';

function TodoListItems() {
  return (
    <>
      {[].map((todo: { id: number; text: string }) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{ paddingTop: '16px' }}
          key={todo.id}
        >
          <Grid item xs={1}>
            <Checkbox />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={8}>
            <TextField fullWidth value={todo.text} />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={3}>
            <Button variant="contained" fullWidth>
              Delete
            </Button>
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h4">Todo List</Typography>
      <TodoListItems />
    </>
  );
}

export default TodoList;
```

In this code:

- The `Typography` component with `variant="h4"` prop is used instead of the `Heading` component to create a heading.
- The `Grid` component with `container` prop is used to create a container for each todo item.
- The `spacing` prop on the `Grid` container is used to create space between the grid items (similar to `pt` in Chakra UI).
- The `style` prop is used to add top padding to the `Grid` container (similar to `pt` in Chakra UI).
- The `Grid` component with `item` prop is used to create grid items for the checkbox, text field, and button.
- The `xs` prop on the `Grid` items is used to specify the grid item's width on extra small screens.
- The `Checkbox` component is used instead of the `Checkbox` component from Chakra UI.
- The `TextField` component is used instead of the `Input` component. The `fullWidth` prop is added to make it take up the full width of the grid item.
- The `variant="contained"` prop is added to the `Button` component to give it a filled style. The `fullWidth` prop is added to make it take up the full width of the grid item.

harihargithub: now can I yarn start?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can now run `yarn start` to start your React application. This command will start the development server and open your application in a web browser.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
yarn start
```

Please note that if you encounter any errors, they might be due to other parts of your code that are still using Chakra UI. You'll need to update all parts of your code to use Material-UI before you can successfully start your application.

GitHub Copilot: It seems like you're still having issues related to Chakra UI. The error message indicates that there's still some part of your code or dependencies that's trying to import from Chakra UI.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Search for any remaining Chakra UI imports:** Use the search functionality in your code editor to find any remaining imports from `@chakra-ui`. If you find any, replace them with equivalent components from Material-UI.

2. **Check your dependencies:** Look at your `package.json` file and check if any of your dependencies are using Chakra UI. If they are, you might need to find alternatives for those dependencies.

3. **Remove Chakra UI from your project:** If you're sure that you've replaced all uses of Chakra UI in your code, you can remove Chakra UI from your project. Here's how you can do it:

   ```bash
   yarn remove @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/core
   ```

After taking these steps, try running `yarn start` again. If you're still having issues, please share more details about your project setup and I'll be happy to help further.

Here are a few more steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Remove all Chakra UI packages:** It seems like not all Chakra UI packages were removed. Try removing the `@chakra-ui/transition` package and any other Chakra UI packages that might still be in your `node_modules` directory:

   ```bash
   yarn remove @chakra-ui/transition
   ```

   Repeat this command for any other Chakra UI packages that you find in your `node_modules` directory.

2. **Check your dependencies again:** Look at your `package.json` file and check if any of your dependencies are using Chakra UI. If they are, you might need to find alternatives for those dependencies.

3. **Delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your packages:** If you're still having issues, it might help to delete your `node_modules` directory and reinstall your packages. Here's how you can do it:

   yarn install
   ```

After taking these steps, try running `yarn start` again. If you're still having issues, please share more details about your project setup and I'll be happy to help further.

harihargithub: is this fine from VS Code Terminal PowerShell -
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item yarn.lock
Then yarn

GitHub Copilot: Yes, those commands are correct for PowerShell in Windows. They will delete the `node_modules` directory and the `yarn.lock` file, and then reinstall all dependencies.

Here's what each command does:

- `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules`: This command deletes the `node_modules` directory and all of its contents. The `-Recurse` flag is used to delete all subdirectories and files, and the `-Force` flag is used to ignore read-only attributes and to confirm all prompts automatically.

- `Remove-Item yarn.lock`: This command deletes the `yarn.lock` file. The `yarn.lock` file is used by Yarn to lock the versions of your dependencies for consistent installs.

- `yarn`: This command installs all dependencies as specified in your `package.json` file.

After running these commands, you should be able to run `yarn start` to start your application. If you're still having issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: "dependencies": {
"@chakra-ui/react": "^2.8.2", - is this ok as still chakra appearning here

GitHub Copilot: No, if you're no longer using Chakra UI in your project, you should remove it from your `package.json` file. The presence of `@chakra-ui/react` in your `dependencies` means that it will be installed when you run `yarn install` or `yarn`.

You can remove it manually by deleting the line `"@chakra-ui/react": "^2.8.2",` from your `package.json` file, or you can use the `yarn remove` command:

```bash
yarn remove @chakra-ui/react
```

After removing it, make sure to run `yarn` or `yarn install` to update your `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file. Then, you should be able to run `yarn start` without encountering issues related to Chakra UI.

harihargithub: then should I again delete node_modules?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, after removing `@chakra-ui/react` from your `package.json` file, you should delete the `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file, and then reinstall your dependencies. This will ensure that Chakra UI is completely removed from your project.

Here are the commands to do this in PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item yarn.lock
yarn
```

After running these commands, you should be able to run `yarn start` without encountering issues related to Chakra UI.

harihargithub: This also needs update please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can remove the `ColorModeScript` import and usage from Chakra UI as you're not using it anymore. Here's how your updated `index.tsx` file should look:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { App } from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

This code should work as long as all other parts of your code have been updated to not use Chakra UI.

harihargithub: 'React.StrictMode' cannot be used as a JSX component.
Its type 'ExoticComponent<{ children?: ReactNode; }>' is not a valid JSX element type.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that there's an issue with using `React.StrictMode` as a JSX component. This is unusual because `React.StrictMode` is a built-in component in React and should work without issues.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this:

1. **Check your React version:** Make sure you're using a recent version of React. You can check your React version by looking at the `dependencies` section in your `package.json` file. If you're not using a recent version, you can update it with the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn upgrade react react-dom
   ```

2. **Import React:** In older versions of React (before React 17), you needed to import the `React` object to use JSX. If you're using an older version of React, make sure you're importing React at the top of your file:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   // ...
   ```

3. **Check your TypeScript version:** If you're using TypeScript, make sure you're using a recent version that's compatible with your React version. You can check your TypeScript version by looking at the `devDependencies` section in your `package.json` file. If you're not using a recent version, you can update it with the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn upgrade typescript
   ```

After trying these steps, if you're still having issues, please share more details about your project setup and I'll be happy to help further.

Type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
Property 'children' is missing in type

GitHub Copilot: This error is typically related to TypeScript and the types it expects for JSX elements. It seems like TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of `React.StrictMode`.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Update TypeScript and React types:** Make sure you're using the latest versions of TypeScript and the TypeScript types for React. You can update them with the following commands:

   ```bash
   yarn upgrade typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

2. **Check your `tsconfig.json` file:** Make sure your TypeScript configuration is set up correctly for JSX. In your `tsconfig.json` file, you should have the following settings:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "jsx": "react"
     }
   }
   ```

   This tells TypeScript to interpret JSX as React elements.

3. **Restart your development server:** Sometimes, these types of issues can be resolved by restarting your development server. If you're running a server, stop it with Ctrl+C and then start it again with `yarn start`.

If none of these solutions work, please share your `tsconfig.json` file and the versions of React, TypeScript, and the TypeScript types for React that you're using. This will help me provide a more accurate solution.

harihargithub: Please check

GitHub Copilot: Your `tsconfig.json` file seems to be correctly configured for a React project. The `"jsx": "react-jsx"` setting is correct for React 17 and later.

However, the error you're seeing might be due to a mismatch between your TypeScript version and your React and @types/react versions.

Please ensure that you're using compatible versions of TypeScript, React, and @types/react. For React 17, you should be using TypeScript 4.1 or later and @types/react 17 or later.

You can check your current versions in your `package.json` file. If you need to upgrade, you can use the following commands:

```bash
yarn upgrade react react-dom
yarn upgrade typescript
yarn upgrade @types/react @types/react-dom
```

After upgrading, remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file, and then reinstall your dependencies:

```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item yarn.lock
yarn
```

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please share the versions of React, TypeScript, and @types/react that you're using.

harihargithub: Now chakra here

GitHub Copilot: The code you've shared is using Chakra UI for the color mode switcher component. If you're no longer using Chakra UI in your project, you'll need to replace this component with an alternative.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement a dark mode switcher without Chakra UI, using React's built-in hooks and context API:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  mode: 'light',
  toggleMode: () => {},
});

export const ThemeProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState('light');

  const toggleMode = () => {
    setMode(mode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ mode, toggleMode }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC = () => {
  const { mode, toggleMode } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleMode}>
      Switch to {mode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
    </button>
  );
};
```

In this code:

- `ThemeProvider` is a context provider that holds the current theme mode and a function to toggle the mode.
- `ColorModeSwitcher` is a button that toggles the theme mode when clicked.

You would use these components in your app like this:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, ColorModeSwitcher } from './ColorModeSwitcher';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <ColorModeSwitcher />
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't handle things like persisting the user's chosen mode across page reloads. You might want to use a more robust solution for a real-world app.

Type 'ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of `ThemeContext.Provider`, which is a built-in component in React's Context API.

This error might be due to a mismatch between your TypeScript version and your React and @types/react versions. Please ensure that you're using compatible versions of TypeScript, React, and @types/react.

You can check your current versions in your `package.json` file. If you need to upgrade, you can use the following commands:

```bash
yarn upgrade react react-dom
yarn upgrade typescript
yarn upgrade @types/react @types/react-dom
```

After upgrading, remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file, and then reinstall your dependencies:

```bash
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item yarn.lock
yarn
```

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please share the versions of React, TypeScript, and @types/react that you're using.

harihargithub: please use @material-ui/core';

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can replace the Chakra UI components with Material-UI components. Here's how you might implement a dark mode switcher with Material-UI:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { IconButton, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof IconButton>;

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = (props) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const darkMode = theme.palette.type === 'dark';
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState(darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light');

  const toggleColorMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const SwitchIcon = mode === 'light' ? Brightness4Icon : Brightness7Icon;

  return (
    <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={toggleColorMode} {...props}>
      <SwitchIcon />
    </IconButton>
  );
};
```

In this code:

- `ColorModeSwitcher` is an `IconButton` that toggles the theme mode when clicked.
- `SwitchIcon` is either `Brightness4Icon` (a moon icon) or `Brightness7Icon` (a sun icon), depending on the current theme mode.

Please note that this code assumes you're using Material-UI's built-in theming system to handle dark mode. If you're not, you'll need to implement your own logic to switch between light and dark mode.

harihargithub: Cannot find module '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that TypeScript can't find the `@material-ui/icons/Brightness4` module. This module is part of the `@material-ui/icons` package, which contains all the Material-UI icons.

If you haven't installed this package yet, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
yarn add @material-ui/icons
```

After installing the package, TypeScript should be able to find the `Brightness4` and `Brightness7` icons. If you're still having issues, try restarting your development server or your IDE. Sometimes, TypeScript needs to be restarted to recognize newly installed packages.

Property 'children' is missing in type 'ReactElement<ThemeProviderProps<DefaultTheme>, string

GitHub Copilot: The error messages indicate two issues:

1. `createMuiTheme` is deprecated and should be replaced with `createTheme`.
2. TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of `ThemeProvider`.

Here's how you can address these issues:

1. **Replace `createMuiTheme` with `createTheme`:** As the error message suggests, `createMuiTheme` is deprecated and should be replaced with `createTheme`. Here's how you can do this:

   ```tsx
   import { Box, ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@material-ui/core';

   const theme = createTheme();
   ```

2. **Update TypeScript and React types:** The issue with `ThemeProvider` might be due to a mismatch between your TypeScript version and your React and @types/react versions. Please ensure that you're using compatible versions of TypeScript, React, and @types/react.

   You can check your current versions in your `package.json` file. If you need to upgrade, you can use the following commands:

   ```bash
   yarn upgrade react react-dom
   yarn upgrade typescript
   yarn upgrade @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

   After upgrading, remember to delete your `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file, and then reinstall your dependencies:

   ```bash

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that TypeScript is having trouble understanding the type of `ThemeProvider` from Material-UI. This is likely due to a conflict with the `ThemeProvider` from styled-components, which also exports a component with the same name.

If you're using both Material-UI and styled-components in your project, you'll need to import one of the `ThemeProvider` components under a different name to avoid this conflict. Here's how you can do this for the Material-UI `ThemeProvider`:

```tsx
import { Box, createTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import { ThemeProvider as MuiThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

const theme = createTheme();

export function App() {
  return (
    <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Box maxWidth="8xl" margin="auto" p={5}>
        <TopBar />
        <TodoList />
        <TodoAdd />
      </Box>
    </MuiThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In this code, `ThemeProvider` from Material-UI is imported as `MuiThemeProvider` to avoid the conflict with the `ThemeProvider` from styled-components.

(alias) function MuiThemeProvider<T = DefaultTheme>(props: ThemeProviderProps<T>): React.ReactElement<ThemeProviderProps<T>>
import MuiThemeProvider

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that `MuiThemeProvider` is declared but never used. This is because you've imported `ThemeProvider` as `MuiThemeProvider`, but you're still using `ThemeProvider` in your JSX.

To fix this, you should replace `ThemeProvider` with `MuiThemeProvider` in your JSX. Here's how you can do this:

```tsx
import { Box, createTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import { ThemeProvider as MuiThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

const theme = createTheme();

export function App() {
  return (
    <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Box maxWidth="8xl" margin="auto" p={5}>
        <TopBar />
        <TodoList />
        <TodoAdd />
      </Box>
    </MuiThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In this code, `MuiThemeProvider` is used instead of `ThemeProvider` to provide the theme to your components. This should resolve the error.

harihargithub: APP finally rendering now without errors but 1. Theme toggle only the icon gets changed not the body 2. Add todo though I am able to enter string it is not getting stored and also not displayed 3. what is load for?

GitHub Copilot: 1. Theme Toggle: The theme toggle is changing the icon because the `SwitchIcon` is being set based on the `mode` state. However, it seems like the theme of the application itself is not being changed. You need to use a context or a state management library to change the theme of your application when the toggle is clicked.

2. Add Todo: If the todos are not getting stored or displayed, it might be because the state update or the display logic for the todos is not implemented correctly. Ensure that when a new todo is added, it is being added to your todos state and that state is being used to display the todos.

3. Load: Without more context, it's hard to say what "load" is for. It could be a function or a button to load more data, or to load data from a server when the application starts. It depends on how it's used in your application.

If you share the relevant code, I can provide more specific guidance.

harihargithub: check now please

GitHub Copilot: The `ColorModeSwitcher` component you've shared toggles the `mode` state between 'light' and 'dark' and changes the icon accordingly. However, it doesn't actually change the theme of your application.

To change the theme, you need to use the `ThemeProvider` from Material-UI and dynamically set the theme based on the `mode` state. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  IconButton,
  useTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
  createMuiTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof IconButton>;

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = (props) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const darkMode = theme.palette.type === 'dark';
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState(darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light');

  const toggleColorMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const SwitchIcon = mode === 'light' ? Brightness4Icon : Brightness7Icon;

  const appliedTheme = React.useMemo(
    () =>
      createMuiTheme({
        palette: {
          type: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={appliedTheme}>
      <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={toggleColorMode} {...props}>
        <SwitchIcon />
      </IconButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

In this updated code, I've added a `ThemeProvider` that wraps the `IconButton`. The `ThemeProvider` takes a `theme` prop, which is set to `appliedTheme`. `appliedTheme` is a memoized value that calls `createMuiTheme` with a palette type based on the `mode` state. This will cause the theme of your application to change when the `mode` state changes.

harihargithub: TypeScript error in C:/Users/nhari/OneDrive/Documents/iitr gl apcifsd/React JS 3/zustand-yarn/todo-zustand/src/components/ColorModeSwitcher.tsx(28,11):

GitHub Copilot: The error message is indicating that the `mode` variable, which is a string, is not assignable to the type 'PaletteType | undefined'. The `type` property of the palette object in the Material-UI theme expects a value of 'light' or 'dark', or undefined, not any string.

To fix this, you can assert that `mode` is of type `PaletteType` when you assign it to `type`. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
const appliedTheme = React.useMemo(
  () =>
    createMuiTheme({
      palette: {
        type: mode as PaletteType,
      },
    }),
  [mode],
);
```

In this code, `mode as PaletteType` is a type assertion that tells TypeScript to treat `mode` as a `PaletteType`. This should resolve the error.

harihargithub: he signature '(options?: ThemeOptions | undefined, ...args: object[]): Theme' of 'createMuiTheme' is deprecated.ts(6387)
Cannot find name 'PaletteType'.ts(2304)
type PaletteType = /_unresolved_/ '

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `PaletteType` type is not directly importable from Material-UI. Instead, you can use a string literal type to ensure that `mode` is either 'light' or 'dark'. Also, `createMuiTheme` is deprecated in the latest versions of Material-UI (v5), you should use `createTheme` instead.

Here's how you can update your code:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  IconButton,
  useTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
  createTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof IconButton>;

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = (props) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const darkMode = theme.palette.mode === 'dark';
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState<'light' | 'dark'>(
    darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
  );

  const toggleColorMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const SwitchIcon = mode === 'light' ? Brightness4Icon : Brightness7Icon;

  const appliedTheme = React.useMemo(
    () =>
      createTheme({
        palette: {
          mode: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={appliedTheme}>
      <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={toggleColorMode} {...props}>
        <SwitchIcon />
      </IconButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

In this updated code, I've replaced `createMuiTheme` with `createTheme` and `type` with `mode` in the palette object. I've also updated the initial state of `mode` to be a string literal type `'light' | 'dark'`, which ensures that `mode` can only be 'light' or 'dark'.

harihargithub: bject literal may only specify known properties, and 'mode' does not exist in type 'PaletteOptions'.ts(2353)

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `mode` property is not available in the `palette` object in Material-UI v4. Instead, you should use the `type` property. Here's how you can update your code:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  IconButton,
  useTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
  createMuiTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof IconButton>;

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = (props) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const darkMode = theme.palette.type === 'dark';
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState<'light' | 'dark'>(
    darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
  );

  const toggleColorMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const SwitchIcon = mode === 'light' ? Brightness4Icon : Brightness7Icon;

  const appliedTheme = React.useMemo(
    () =>
      createMuiTheme({
        palette: {
          type: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={appliedTheme}>
      <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={toggleColorMode} {...props}>
        <SwitchIcon />
      </IconButton>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

In this updated code, I've replaced `createTheme` with `createMuiTheme` and `mode` with `type` in the palette object. This should work with Material-UI v4.

harihargithub: no errors not but page not turning dark

GitHub Copilot: The issue is that the `ThemeProvider` is only wrapping the `IconButton` in your `ColorModeSwitcher` component. This means that only the `IconButton` is receiving the updated theme when the color mode is toggled, not your entire application.

To fix this, you should move the `ThemeProvider` to wrap your entire application. This is typically done in your root component (like `App.tsx` or `index.tsx`). Here's an example of how you can do this:

```tsx
// App.tsx or index.tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import { ColorModeSwitcher } from './ColorModeSwitcher';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [mode, setMode] = React.useState<'light' | 'dark'>('light');

  const toggleColorMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const appliedTheme = React.useMemo(
    () =>
      createMuiTheme({
        palette: {
          type: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={appliedTheme}>
      <ColorModeSwitcher onClick={toggleColorMode} />
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this updated code, I've moved the `ThemeProvider`, `mode` state, `toggleColorMode` function, and `appliedTheme` to the `App` component. The `ColorModeSwitcher` component now takes an `onClick` prop, which is set to `toggleColorMode`. This will cause your entire application to receive the updated theme when the color mode is toggled.

harihargithub: it is createTheme so provide fresh file please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's how you can modify your `App.tsx` to include the theme toggle functionality:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { Box, createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

export function App() {
  const [mode, setMode] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>('light');

  const theme = useMemo(
    () =>
      createTheme({
        palette: {
          mode: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  const toggleMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Box maxWidth="8xl" margin="auto" p={5}>
        <TopBar toggleMode={toggleMode} />
        <TodoList />
        <TodoAdd />
      </Box>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In this updated code, I've added a `mode` state to the `App` component that's either 'light' or 'dark'. I've also added a `toggleMode` function that toggles the `mode` state. The `theme` is now a memoized value that calls `createTheme` with a palette mode based on the `mode` state. This will cause the theme of your application to change when the `mode` state changes.

I've also passed `toggleMode` as a prop to `TopBar`. You'll need to modify `TopBar` to accept this prop and pass it to `ColorModeSwitcher` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `ColorModeSwitcher` is clicked.

harihargithub: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'mode' does not exist in type 'PaletteOptions'.

Type '{ toggleMode: () => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.

(property) toggleMode: () => void

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `mode` property is not available in the `palette` object in Material-UI v4. Instead, you should use the `type` property.

Also, the error about `toggleMode` not existing on type 'IntrinsicAttributes' is because you're trying to pass a prop `toggleMode` to the `TopBar` component that it doesn't accept. You need to modify the `TopBar` component to accept a `toggleMode` prop and pass it to the `ColorModeSwitcher`.

Here's how you can update your code:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { Box, createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

export function App() {
  const [mode, setMode] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>('light');

  const theme = useMemo(
    () =>
      createMuiTheme({
        palette: {
          type: mode,
        },
      }),
    [mode],
  );

  const toggleMode = () => {
    setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Box maxWidth="8xl" margin="auto" p={5}>
        <TopBar toggleMode={toggleMode} />
        <TodoList />
        <TodoAdd />
      </Box>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

In your `TopBar` component, you should accept `toggleMode` as a prop and pass it to `ColorModeSwitcher`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleMode: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleMode }) => {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton edge="end" color="inherit" onClick={toggleMode}>
          <Brightness4Icon />
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, `TopBar` now accepts a `toggleMode` prop and passes it to the `IconButton` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `IconButton` is clicked.

harihargithub: Type '{ toggleMode: () => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `TopBar` component does not accept a prop named `toggleMode`. You need to modify the `TopBar` component to accept this prop.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleMode: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleMode }) => {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton edge="end" color="inherit" onClick={toggleMode}>
          <Brightness4Icon />
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, `TopBar` now accepts a `toggleMode` prop and passes it to the `IconButton` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `IconButton` is clicked.

harihargithub: On clicking the toggle theme icon the todo input is toggled not the theme

GitHub Copilot: The issue seems to be that the `toggleColorMode` function is only changing the local state of the `ColorModeSwitcher` component and not the global theme state of your application.

To fix this, you should lift the state up to a parent component that wraps your entire application, such as `App.tsx`. Then, pass down the `toggleColorMode` function as a prop to `ColorModeSwitcher`.

Here's how you can modify your `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core';
import ColorModeSwitcher from './ColorModeSwitcher';

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState('light');

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <ColorModeSwitcher onClick={toggleTheme} />
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

And here's how you can modify your `ColorModeSwitcher.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { IconButton, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = {
  onClick: () => void;
};

const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = ({ onClick }) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const SwitchIcon =
    theme.palette.type === 'light' ? Brightness4Icon : Brightness7Icon;

  return (
    <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={onClick}>
      <SwitchIcon />
    </IconButton>
  );
};

export default ColorModeSwitcher;
```

In this updated code, the `toggleTheme` function in `App.tsx` changes the global theme state of your application, and it's passed down to `ColorModeSwitcher` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the theme of your entire application to change when the `ColorModeSwitcher` is clicked.

harihargithub: App.tsx is made active and please provide fresh file please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the updated `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState('light');

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList />
      <TodoAdd />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this updated code, I've renamed `toggleMode` to `toggleTheme` for clarity, and I'm passing it as a prop to `TopBar`. You'll need to modify `TopBar` to accept this prop and pass it to `ColorModeSwitcher`. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `ColorModeSwitcher` is clicked.

harihargithub: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'PaletteType | undefined'.ts(2322)

ype '{ toggleTheme: () => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & TopBarProps'.
Property 'toggleTheme' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & TopBarProps'.ts(2322)

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `type` property in the `palette` object in Material-UI theme expects a value of 'light' or 'dark', or undefined, not any string. You can assert that `themeMode` is of type `PaletteType` when you assign it to `type`.

Also, the error about `toggleTheme` not existing on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & TopBarProps' is because you're trying to pass a prop `toggleTheme` to the `TopBar` component that it doesn't accept. You need to modify the `TopBar` component to accept a `toggleTheme` prop and pass it to the `ColorModeSwitcher`.

Here's how you can update your code:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, PaletteType } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState<PaletteType>('light');

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList />
      <TodoAdd />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In your `TopBar` component, you should accept `toggleTheme` as a prop and pass it to `ColorModeSwitcher`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleTheme }) => {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton edge="end" color="inherit" onClick={toggleTheme}>
          <Brightness4Icon />
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, `TopBar` now accepts a `toggleTheme` prop and passes it to the `IconButton` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `IconButton` is clicked.

harihargithub: still same issue - toggle todo input happening instead of theme

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems like there might be a mix-up in the function handling the theme toggle and the todo input toggle.

To ensure the theme is toggling correctly, you need to make sure the `toggleTheme` function is correctly passed to the component that handles the theme switch (usually a button or a switch in the UI), and that this component calls `toggleTheme` when it's interacted with.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

In your `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, PaletteType } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState<PaletteType>('light');

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList />
      <TodoAdd />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In your `TopBar.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleTheme }) => {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton edge="end" color="inherit" onClick={toggleTheme}>
          <Brightness4Icon />
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, `TopBar` now accepts a `toggleTheme` prop and passes it to the `IconButton` as the `onClick` prop. This will cause the color mode to toggle when the `IconButton` is clicked.

Please make sure that the `toggleTheme` function is not being used elsewhere to toggle the todo input. If it is, you should create a separate function to handle the todo input toggle.

harihargithub: still the same and keep some console log to check

GitHub Copilot: I understand the issue persists. Let's add some console logs to help debug the issue.

In your `App.tsx`, add a console log in the `toggleTheme` function to log the current theme mode:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, PaletteType } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState<PaletteType>('light');

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => {
      const nextMode = prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
      console.log(`Changing theme from ${prevMode} to ${nextMode}`);
      return nextMode;
    });
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList />
      <TodoAdd />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In your `TopBar.tsx`, add a console log in the `onClick` handler to log when the theme toggle button is clicked:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleTheme }) => {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton
          edge="end"
          color="inherit"
          onClick={() => {
            console.log('Theme toggle button clicked');
            toggleTheme();
          }}
        >
          <Brightness4Icon />
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

Now, when you click the theme toggle button, you should see the logs in your browser's console. This will help you understand if the `toggleTheme` function is being called and if the theme mode is being updated correctly.

harihargithub: Theme toggle button clicked
App.tsx:19 Changing theme from dark to light
but no effect in page

GitHub Copilot: If the theme is not changing on the page, it's possible that the components are not using the theme provided by the `ThemeProvider`.

In Material-UI, you can use the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme. You can then use the `theme.palette.type` property to determine whether the theme is 'light' or 'dark', and style your components accordingly.

Here's an example of how you can use the theme in a component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <Paper style={{ backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default }}>
      This component uses the current theme's background color.
    </Paper>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `MyComponent` uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme, and then uses the `theme.palette.background.default` property to set its background color. When the theme changes, the background color of `MyComponent` will change accordingly.

Please make sure that your components are using the theme provided by the `ThemeProvider` in a similar way. If they are not, they will not respond to changes in the theme.

GitHub Copilot: The warnings you're seeing are because you've imported the `Brightness7Icon` but you're not using it anywhere in your code.

If you want to use the `Brightness7Icon` to represent the light mode, you can modify your `IconButton` in `TopBar.tsx` to display either `Brightness4Icon` for dark mode or `Brightness7Icon` for light mode based on the current theme.

Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  AppBar,
  Toolbar,
  Typography,
  IconButton,
  useTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleTheme }) => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton
          edge="end"
          color="inherit"
          onClick={() => {
            console.log('Theme toggle button clicked');
            toggleTheme();
          }}
        >
          {theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? (
            <Brightness7Icon />
          ) : (
            <Brightness4Icon />
          )}
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, the `IconButton` now displays `Brightness7Icon` when the theme is dark (indicating that clicking the button will switch to light mode), and `Brightness4Icon` when the theme is light (indicating that clicking the button will switch to dark mode). This should resolve the warnings about `Brightness7Icon` being unused.

harihargithub: Mycomponent you suggest how to implement?

GitHub Copilot: The `MyComponent` example I provided was a general example of how to use the theme in a Material-UI component. You can apply the same concept to your `TopBar` component to change its appearance based on the theme.

Here's how you can modify your `TopBar` component to change the icon based on the theme:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  AppBar,
  Toolbar,
  Typography,
  IconButton,
  useTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type TopBarProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
};

const TopBar: React.FC<TopBarProps> = ({ toggleTheme }) => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          Todo List
        </Typography>
        <IconButton
          edge="end"
          color="inherit"
          onClick={() => {
            console.log('Theme toggle button clicked');
            toggleTheme();
          }}
        >
          {theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? (
            <Brightness7Icon />
          ) : (
            <Brightness4Icon />
          )}
        </IconButton>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
};

export default TopBar;
```

In this updated code, the `IconButton` now displays `Brightness7Icon` when the theme is dark (indicating that clicking the button will switch to light mode), and `Brightness4Icon` when the theme is light (indicating that clicking the button will switch to dark mode). This should resolve the warnings about `Brightness7Icon` being unused.

harihargithub: No only input todo is toggled

GitHub Copilot: I see, it seems like the theme toggle is not working as expected, but the todo input toggle is.

Let's try to isolate the issue.

1. First, ensure that the `toggleTheme` function is only used for toggling the theme and not for any other functionality like toggling the todo input.

2. Second, check if the `ThemeProvider` is wrapping your entire app component tree. Only the components inside `ThemeProvider` will have access to the theme.

3. Lastly, ensure that your components are using the theme from `ThemeProvider`. If they are not, they will not respond to changes in the theme.

If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of your `TopBar`, `TodoList`, and `TodoAdd` components? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and the `toggleTheme` function.

harihargithub: check it please

GitHub Copilot: The `App.tsx` file you've shared seems to be correctly set up for theme toggling. The `toggleTheme` function is correctly defined and passed to the `TopBar` component. The `ThemeProvider` is also correctly wrapping all your components.

The issue might be in how the `TopBar`, `TodoList`, or `TodoAdd` components are using the theme or the `toggleTheme` function.

Could you please share the relevant parts of your `TopBar`, `TodoList`, and `TodoAdd` components? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and the `toggleTheme` function.

harihargithub: check this please

GitHub Copilot: The `TodoList` component you've shared doesn't seem to be using the theme from `ThemeProvider`. This is why it's not responding to changes in the theme.

To make `TodoList` respond to theme changes, you can use the `useTheme` hook from Material-UI to access the current theme, and then use the theme's properties to style your components.

Here's an example of how you can modify your `TodoList` component to use the theme:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  Button,
  TextField,
  Checkbox,
  Typography,
  Grid,
  useTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';

function TodoListItems() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {[].map((todo: { id: number; text: string }) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
          }}
          key={todo.id}
        >
          <Grid item xs={1}>
            <Checkbox />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={8}>
            <TextField fullWidth value={todo.text} />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={3}>
            <Button variant="contained" fullWidth>
              Delete
            </Button>
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

function TodoList() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h4">Todo List</Typography>
      <TodoListItems />
    </>
  );
}

export default TodoList;
```

In this updated code, `TodoListItems` uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme, and then uses the `theme.palette.background.default` property to set the background color of the `Grid` component. When the theme changes, the background color of the `Grid` component will change accordingly.

Please note that this is just an example. You can use the theme's properties to style your components in any way you want.

harihargithub: still the same and I have selected all related files for you to double check please

GitHub Copilot: The `ColorModeSwitcher` component you've shared is creating its own theme and `ThemeProvider`, which is why it's not affecting the rest of your app.

Instead of creating a new theme inside `ColorModeSwitcher`, you should use the `toggleTheme` function passed from the parent component to change the theme.

Here's how you can modify `ColorModeSwitcher`:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { IconButton, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';
import Brightness4Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness4';
import Brightness7Icon from '@material-ui/icons/Brightness7';

type ColorModeSwitcherProps = {
  toggleTheme: () => void;
} & React.ComponentProps<typeof IconButton>;

export const ColorModeSwitcher: React.FC<ColorModeSwitcherProps> = ({
  toggleTheme,
  ...props
}) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const SwitchIcon =
    theme.palette.type === 'dark' ? Brightness7Icon : Brightness4Icon;

  return (
    <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={toggleTheme} {...props}>
      <SwitchIcon />
    </IconButton>
  );
};
```

In this updated code, `ColorModeSwitcher` accepts a `toggleTheme` prop and calls it when the `IconButton` is clicked. The icon changes based on the current theme.

You'll need to pass the `toggleTheme` function to `ColorModeSwitcher` in your `TopBar` component:

```tsx
<ColorModeSwitcher toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
```

This should make the theme toggle affect the entire app.

harihargithub: still the same

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. Let's try to debug this issue step by step.

1. **Check if the `toggleTheme` function is being called**: Add a `console.log` statement in the `toggleTheme` function in `App.tsx` to check if it's being called when the button is clicked.

```tsx
const toggleTheme = () => {
  console.log('toggleTheme function called');
  setMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
};
```

2. **Check if the theme is changing**: Add a `console.log` statement in `App.tsx` to log the current theme.

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Current theme:', mode);
}, [mode]);
```

3. **Check if the components are using the theme**: In your components (like `TodoList`), add a `console.log` statement to log the current theme.

```tsx
const theme = useTheme();
console.log('Current theme in TodoList:', theme.palette.type);
```

After adding these `console.log` statements, open your browser's console and click the theme toggle button. You should see the `toggleTheme function called` message, followed by the `Current theme:` message with the new theme, and then the `Current theme in TodoList:` message with the new theme.

If you don't see these messages, or if the theme in `TodoList` doesn't change, it means there's an issue with how the `toggleTheme` function is being called or how the theme is being used in your components. Please share the console output and the relevant parts of your components so I can help you debug the issue.

harihargithub:
TopBar.tsx:29 Theme toggle button clicked
App.tsx:17 toggleTheme function called
App.tsx:20 Changing theme from dark to light
but page not taking effect

GitHub Copilot: The console logs indicate that the `toggleTheme` function is being called and the theme state in `App.tsx` is being updated. This means the issue is likely with how the theme is being used in your components.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **Check if the components are inside the `ThemeProvider`**: Only the components that are inside the `ThemeProvider` in `App.tsx` will have access to the theme. Make sure all your components are rendered inside the `ThemeProvider`.

2. **Check if the components are using the theme**: The components need to use the `useTheme` hook from Material-UI to access the current theme. If they're not using this hook, they won't respond to changes in the theme.

3. **Check if the components are re-rendering when the theme changes**: If the components are not re-rendering when the theme changes, they won't reflect the new theme. You can check this by adding a `console.log` statement in your components and seeing if it's logged when the theme changes.

If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of your components where you're using the theme? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and why they're not responding to changes in the theme.

harihargithub: anything to change here?

GitHub Copilot: The `store.ts` file you've shared is responsible for managing the state of your todos. It doesn't seem to be related to the theme toggling issue you're facing.

The theme toggling functionality is likely implemented in your `App.tsx` file and used in your components through the `useTheme` hook from Material-UI. The issue is likely with how the theme is being used in your components, not with how your todos are being managed.

If you're still facing issues with theme toggling, could you please share the relevant parts of your components where you're using the theme? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and why they're not responding to changes in the theme.

harihargithub: Shall share files one by one - is it fine?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Please share the files where you're using the theme or the `toggleTheme` function. This will help me understand how they're using the theme and why they're not responding to changes in the theme.

harihargithub: App

GitHub Copilot: The `App.tsx` file you've shared seems to be correctly set up for theme toggling. The `toggleTheme` function is correctly defined and passed to the `TopBar` component. The `ThemeProvider` is also correctly wrapping all your components.

The issue might be in how the `TopBar`, `TodoList`, or `TodoAdd` components are using the theme or the `toggleTheme` function.

Could you please share the relevant parts of your `TopBar`, `TodoList`, and `TodoAdd` components? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and the `toggleTheme` function.

harihargithub: topbar

GitHub Copilot: The `TopBar.tsx` file you've shared seems to be correctly set up for theme toggling. The `toggleTheme` function is correctly received as a prop and called when the `IconButton` is clicked. The icon also changes based on the current theme.

The issue might be in how the `TodoList` or `TodoAdd` components are using the theme.

Could you please share the relevant parts of your `TodoList` and `TodoAdd` components? This will help me understand how they're using the theme and why they're not responding to changes in the theme.

harihargithub: todolist

GitHub Copilot: The `TodoList.tsx` file you've shared seems to be correctly set up for theme toggling. The `useTheme` hook is correctly used to access the current theme, and the theme's `background.default` property is used to set the background color of the `Grid` component.

The issue might be in how the `TodoAdd` component is using the theme.

Could you please share the relevant parts of your `TodoAdd` component? This will help me understand how it's using the theme and why it's not responding to changes in the theme.

harihargithub: todoadd

GitHub Copilot: The `TodoAdd.tsx` file you've shared is not using the theme from `ThemeProvider`. This is why it's not responding to changes in the theme.

To make `TodoAdd` respond to theme changes, you can use the `useTheme` hook from Material-UI to access the current theme, and then use the theme's properties to style your components.

Here's an example of how you can modify your `TodoAdd` component to use the theme:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, TextField, Grid, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';

function TodoAdd() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <Grid
      container
      spacing={3}
      style={{
        paddingTop: '16px',
        backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
      }}
    >
      <Grid item xs={10}>
        <TextField fullWidth placeholder="New todo" />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={2}>
        <Button variant="contained" fullWidth>
          Add Todo
        </Button>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
}

export default TodoAdd;
```

In this updated code, `TodoAdd` uses the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme, and then uses the `theme.palette.background.default` property to set the background color of the `Grid` component. When the theme changes, the background color of the `Grid` component will change accordingly.

Please note that this is just an example. You can use the theme's properties to style your components in any way you want.

harihargithub: Now theme toggle rendering and add & list not woking - please check this

GitHub Copilot: The `TodoAdd` component you've shared doesn't seem to have any functionality for adding todos. You need to add a state for the todo input and a function for handling the "Add Todo" button click.

Here's how you can add this functionality:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, TextField, Grid, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';

function TodoAdd({ addTodo }) {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const [input, setInput] = React.useState('');

  const handleAddTodo = () => {
    addTodo(input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <Grid
      container
      spacing={3}
      style={{
        paddingTop: '16px',
        backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
      }}
    >
      <Grid item xs={10}>
        <TextField
          fullWidth
          placeholder="New todo"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={2}>
        <Button variant="contained" fullWidth onClick={handleAddTodo}>
          Add Todo
        </Button>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
}

export default TodoAdd;
```

In this updated code, `TodoAdd` has a state `input` for the todo input and a function `handleAddTodo` for handling the "Add Todo" button click. When the button is clicked, `handleAddTodo` calls the `addTodo` function passed from the parent component with the current input, and then clears the input.

You'll need to pass the `addTodo` function to `TodoAdd` in your parent component:

```tsx
<TodoAdd addTodo={addTodo} />
```

This should make the "Add Todo" button work. If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of your parent component and your `TodoList` component? This will help me understand how they're using the `addTodo` function and why they're not working.

harihargithub: This code in this file, is it? -
<TodoAdd addTodo={addTodo} />

GitHub Copilot: Yes, the `<TodoAdd addTodo={addTodo} />` line should be in your parent component, likely `App.tsx`, where `addTodo` is a function that updates the state of your todos.

However, I noticed that your `TodoListItems` component is currently mapping over an empty array. This means that no todo items will be displayed. You should pass your todos state to the `TodoListItems` component and map over that instead.

Here's how you can modify your `TodoListItems` component:

```tsx
function TodoListItems({ todos }) {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo: { id: number; text: string }) => (
        // rest of your code
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

And then pass your todos state to `TodoListItems` in your `TodoList` component:

```tsx
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h4">Todo List</Typography>
      <TodoListItems todos={todos} />
    </>
  );
}
```

You'll also need to pass your todos state to `TodoList` in your parent component:

```tsx
<TodoList todos={todos} />
```

This should make your todo list items appear in your `TodoList` component. If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of your parent component? This will help me understand how it's managing the todos state and why your todo list items are not appearing.

harihargithub: Cannot find name 'todos'.ts(2304)
any - import to be done, is it?

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Cannot find name 'todos'" means that the `todos` variable is not defined in the `TodoListItems` component.

You need to pass `todos` as a prop to the `TodoListItems` component from its parent component. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
function TodoListItems({ todos }) {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo: { id: number; text: string }) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
          }}
          key={todo.id}
          // rest of your code
        />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

In the parent component of `TodoListItems`, you should pass `todos` as a prop:

```tsx
<TodoListItems todos={todos} />
```

In this line, `todos` should be the state or prop in the parent component that contains the list of todos. If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of the parent component of `TodoListItems`? This will help me understand how it's managing the todos state and why the `todos` variable is not defined in `TodoListItems`.

harihargithub: Binding element 'todos' implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7031)
(parameter) todos: any

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Binding element 'todos' implicitly has an 'any' type" means that TypeScript is unable to infer the type of the `todos` prop in the `TodoListItems` component.

You can fix this by explicitly defining the type of the `todos` prop. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

interface TodoListItemsProps {
  todos: Todo[];
}

function TodoListItems({ todos }: TodoListItemsProps) {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
          }}
          key={todo.id}
          // rest of your code
        />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

In this updated code, `Todo` is an interface that represents a todo item, and `TodoListItemsProps` is an interface that represents the props of the `TodoListItems` component. The `todos` prop is now explicitly typed as an array of `Todo` items.

This should fix the TypeScript error. If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of your parent component? This will help me understand how it's managing the todos state and why the `todos` variable is not defined in `TodoListItems`.

harihargithub: Cannot find name 'todos'.ts(2304)
any

GitHub Copilot: The error message "Cannot find name 'todos'" means that the `todos` variable is not defined in the `TodoList` component.

You need to pass `todos` as a prop to the `TodoList` component from its parent component. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

interface TodoListProps {
  todos: Todo[];
}

function TodoList({ todos }: TodoListProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h4">Todo List</Typography>
      <TodoListItems todos={todos} />
    </>
  );
}
```

In the parent component of `TodoList`, you should pass `todos` as a prop:

```tsx
<TodoList todos={todos} />
```

In this line, `todos` should be the state or prop in the parent component that contains the list of todos. If you're still facing issues, could you please share the relevant parts of the parent component of `TodoList`? This will help me understand how it's managing the todos state and why the `todos` variable is not defined in `TodoList`.

harihargithub: <TodoList todos={todos} /> - this here @ App, is it?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. In your `App.tsx` file, you should pass the `todos` state to the `TodoList` component as a prop. However, it seems like you haven't defined a `todos` state in your `App` component yet.

First, you need to define a `todos` state in your `App` component. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState<Todo[]>([]);
```

Then, you can pass the `todos` state to the `TodoList` component:

```tsx
<TodoList todos={todos} />
```

Here's how your updated `App` component might look:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import TopBar from './TopBar';
import TodoList from './TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './TodoAdd';
import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = React.useState('light');
  const [todos, setTodos] = React.useState<Todo[]>([]);

  const theme = createMuiTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => (prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList todos={todos} />
      <TodoAdd />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This should fix the "Cannot find name 'todos'" error. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: some thing in above file so please provide fresh App.tsx file please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can provide a fresh `App.tsx` file. However, it seems like you haven't implemented the functionality for adding todos yet. For now, I'll add a placeholder `addTodo` function and a `todos` state. Here's how your updated `App.tsx` might look:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, PaletteType } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState<PaletteType>('light');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    console.log('toggleTheme function called');
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => {
      const nextMode = prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
      console.log(`Changing theme from ${prevMode} to ${nextMode}`);
      return nextMode;
    });
  };

  const addTodo = (text: string) => {
    // This is a placeholder function for now.
    // You'll need to implement the functionality for adding todos.
    console.log(`Adding todo: ${text}`);
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList todos={todos} />
      <TodoAdd addTodo={addTodo} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this updated code, `App` has a `todos` state for storing the list of todos and an `addTodo` function for adding new todos. The `todos` state is passed to the `TodoList` component, and the `addTodo` function is passed to the `TodoAdd` component.

Please note that the `addTodo` function is just a placeholder for now. You'll need to implement the functionality for adding todos.

harihargithub: 'setTodos' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)
'setTodos' is assigned a value but never used.eslint@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
const setTodos: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Todo[]>>

GitHub Copilot: The warnings you're seeing are because you've declared the `setTodos` function but you haven't used it yet. This function is used to update the `todos` state.

You'll need to implement the `addTodo` function to use `setTodos`. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```tsx
const addTodo = (text: string) => {
  setTodos((prevTodos) => [
    ...prevTodos,
    {
      id: prevTodos.length > 0 ? prevTodos[prevTodos.length - 1].id + 1 : 1,
      text,
    },
  ]);
};
```

In this updated `addTodo` function, `setTodos` is used to add a new todo to the `todos` state. The new todo's `id` is one more than the `id` of the last todo in `todos`, and its `text` is the text passed to `addTodo`.

This should remove the warnings about `setTodos` being declared but never used. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: const addTodo - to be included here is it?

GitHub Copilot: The `addTodo` function is already included as a prop in your `TodoAdd` component. However, TypeScript is unable to infer the type of the `addTodo` prop, which could lead to type errors.

You can fix this by explicitly defining the type of the `addTodo` prop. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, TextField, Grid, useTheme } from '@material-ui/core';

interface TodoAddProps {
  addTodo: (text: string) => void;
}

function TodoAdd({ addTodo }: TodoAddProps) {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const [input, setInput] = React.useState('');

  const handleAddTodo = () => {
    addTodo(input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <Grid
      container
      spacing={3}
      style={{
        paddingTop: '16px',
        backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
      }}
    >
      <Grid item xs={10}>
        <TextField
          fullWidth
          placeholder="New todo"
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={2}>
        <Button variant="contained" fullWidth onClick={handleAddTodo}>
          Add Todo
        </Button>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
}

export default TodoAdd;
```

In this updated code, `TodoAddProps` is an interface that represents the props of the `TodoAdd` component. The `addTodo` prop is now explicitly typed as a function that takes a string and returns void.

This should fix any potential type errors related to the `addTodo` prop. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: 'setTodos' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)

GitHub Copilot: The warnings you're seeing are because you've declared the `setTodos` function but you haven't used it yet. This function is used to update the `todos` state.

You'll need to implement the `addTodo` function to use `setTodos`. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```tsx

      id: prevTodos.length > 0 ? prevTodos[prevTodos.length - 1].id + 1 : 1,
      text,
    },
  ]);
};
```

In this updated `addTodo` function, `setTodos` is used to add a new todo to the `todos` state. The new todo's `id` is one more than the `id` of the last todo in `todos`, and its `text` is the text passed to `addTodo`.

This should remove the warnings about `setTodos` being declared but never used. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: where to inclue const addTodo?

GitHub Copilot: You should include the `addTodo` function inside your `App` component, right after the `todos` state declaration. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, PaletteType } from '@material-ui/core';
import TopBar from './components/TopBar';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';
import TodoAdd from './components/TodoAdd';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

function App() {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState<PaletteType>('light');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);

  const addTodo = (text: string) => {
    setTodos((prevTodos) => [
      ...prevTodos,
      {
        id: prevTodos.length > 0 ? prevTodos[prevTodos.length - 1].id + 1 : 1,
        text,
      },
    ]);
  };

  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      type: themeMode,
    },
  });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    console.log('toggleTheme function called');
    setThemeMode((prevMode) => {
      const nextMode = prevMode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
      console.log(`Changing theme from ${prevMode} to ${nextMode}`);
      return nextMode;
    });
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <TopBar toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />
      <TodoList todos={todos} />
      <TodoAdd addTodo={addTodo} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this updated code, the `addTodo` function is defined inside the `App` component and passed as a prop to the `TodoAdd` component. This function is used to add a new todo to the `todos` state.

harihargithub: Need to implement Delete function please

GitHub Copilot: To implement a delete function, you'll need to add a `deleteTodo` function in your `App` component and pass it down to your `TodoList` component. This function will take an `id` as a parameter and remove the corresponding todo from the `todos` state.

Here's how you can do it:

In your `App` component:

```tsx
const deleteTodo = (id: number) => {
  setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
};
```

And pass it to your `TodoList` component:

```tsx
<TodoList todos={todos} deleteTodo={deleteTodo} />
```

In your `TodoList` component, you'll need to accept `deleteTodo` as a prop and pass it to each `TodoListItem`:

```tsx
interface TodoListProps {
  todos: Todo[];
  deleteTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

function TodoList({ todos, deleteTodo }: TodoListProps) {
  // ...
  return todos.map((todo) => (
    <TodoListItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} deleteTodo={deleteTodo} />
  ));
}
```

Finally, in your `TodoListItem` component, you'll need to call `deleteTodo` when the delete button is clicked:

```tsx
interface TodoListItemProps {
  todo: Todo;
  deleteTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

function TodoListItem({ todo, deleteTodo }: TodoListItemProps) {
  // ...
  return (
    <ListItem>
      <ListItemText primary={todo.text} />
      <ListItemSecondaryAction>
        <IconButton
          edge="end"
          aria-label="delete"
          onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}
        >
          <DeleteIcon />
        </IconButton>
      </ListItemSecondaryAction>
    </ListItem>
  );
}
```

This should implement the delete functionality for your todos. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: It is removeTodo so accordingly I can change the suggested codes above - deleteTodo to removeTodo, right?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. If you're using `removeTodo` as the function name in your `store.ts`, you should use the same name when passing it as a prop to your components. Here's how you can do it:

In your `App` component:

```tsx
const removeTodo = (id: number) => {
  setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
};
```

And pass it to your `TodoList` component:

```tsx
<TodoList todos={todos} removeTodo={removeTodo} />
```

In your `TodoList` component, you'll need to accept `removeTodo` as a prop and pass it to each `TodoListItem`:

```tsx
interface TodoListProps {
  todos: Todo[];
  removeTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

function TodoList({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListProps) {
  // ...
  return todos.map((todo) => (
    <TodoListItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} removeTodo={removeTodo} />
  ));
}
```

Finally, in your `TodoListItem` component, you'll need to call `removeTodo` when the delete button is clicked:

```tsx
interface TodoListItemProps {
  todo: Todo;
  removeTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

function TodoListItem({ todo, removeTodo }: TodoListItemProps) {
  // ...
  return (
    <ListItem>
      <ListItemText primary={todo.text} />
      <ListItemSecondaryAction>
        <IconButton
          edge="end"
          aria-label="delete"
          onClick={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}
        >
          <DeleteIcon />
        </IconButton>
      </ListItemSecondaryAction>
    </ListItem>
  );
}
```

This should implement the delete functionality for your todos. If you're still facing issues, please let me know.

harihargithub: some confusion here in removeTodo implementation and please advise

GitHub Copilot: I see that you have a `TodoListItems` component that is rendering each todo item. You need to pass the `removeTodo` function to this component as well, and then use it in the `onClick` handler of the Delete button. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
function TodoListItems({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListItemsProps) {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
          }}
          key={todo.id}
        >
          <Grid item xs={1}>
            <Checkbox />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={8}>
            <TextField fullWidth value={todo.text} />
          </Grid>
          <Grid item xs={3}>
            <Button
              variant="contained"
              fullWidth
              onClick={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}
            >
              Delete
            </Button>
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

function TodoList({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListItemsProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h4">Todo List</Typography>
      <TodoListItems todos={todos} removeTodo={removeTodo} />
    </>
  );
}

export default TodoList;
```

In this updated code, the `removeTodo` function is passed as a prop to the `TodoListItems` component and used in the `onClick` handler of the Delete button. When the Delete button is clicked, the `removeTodo` function is called with the `id` of the todo, which removes the todo from the `todos` state.

harihargithub: const removeTodo = (id: number) => {
setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
}; - explain this code by code please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break down the `removeTodo` function:

```typescript
const removeTodo = (id: number) => {
  setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
};
```

1. `const removeTodo = (id: number) => { ... }`: This is the declaration of the `removeTodo` function. It takes one parameter, `id`, which is a number. This `id` is the identifier of the todo item that you want to remove.

2. `setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));`: This is the body of the `removeTodo` function. It calls the `setTodos` function, which is the setter function from the `useState` hook for the `todos` state.

3. `(prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)`: This is the argument passed to `setTodos`. It's a function that takes the previous state (`prevTodos`) and returns a new state.

4. `prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)`: This is the new state. It's the result of calling the `filter` method on `prevTodos`. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

5. `(todo) => todo.id !== id`: This is the function provided to the `filter` method. It takes a todo item and returns `true` if the todo's `id` is not equal to the `id` passed to `removeTodo`, and `false` otherwise. This means that the `filter` method will create a new array that doesn't include the todo with the `id` passed to `removeTodo`.

In summary, the `removeTodo` function removes the todo with the specified `id` from the `todos` state.

harihargithub: It is Zustand Store store.ts here

GitHub Copilot: The code you've shared is using Zustand, a small, fast and scaleable bear necessities state-management solution. It's creating a store that manages a list of todos. Let's break down the key parts:

1. `interface Todo`: This is the shape of a todo item. Each todo has an `id` (number), `text` (string), and `done` (boolean) to indicate whether it's completed.

2. `updateTodo`, `toggleTodo`, `removeTodo`, `addTodo`: These are helper functions to manipulate the todos array. They each take the current todos array and some additional arguments, and return a new todos array.

   - `updateTodo` updates the text of the todo with the given id.
   - `toggleTodo` toggles the `done` status of the todo with the given id.
   - `removeTodo` removes the todo with the given id.
   - `addTodo` adds a new todo with the given text.

3. `interface State`: This is the shape of the state managed by the Zustand store. Currently, it only includes `todos`.

4. `create<State>`: This is where the Zustand store is created. It's initialized with an object that includes the initial state (`todos: []`) and methods to update the state (`addTodo`, `updateTodo`, `toggleTodo`, `removeTodo`).

   - Each method uses the `set` function provided by Zustand to update the state. They call the corresponding helper function to get the new todos array, and then call `set` to update the `todos` in the state.

The `useStore` hook exported from this module can be used in your React components to access and update the state.

harihargithub: const removeTodo = (id: number) => { setTodos((prevTodos) => prevTodos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)); }; - seeking explanation wrt zustand store.ts as earlier you explained in terms of useState

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's break down the `removeTodo` function in the context of Zustand:

```typescript
const removeTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] =>
  todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id);
```

1. `const removeTodo = (todos: Todo[], id: number): Todo[] => {...}`: This is the declaration of the `removeTodo` function. It takes two parameters, `todos` which is an array of `Todo` objects, and `id`, which is a number. This `id` is the identifier of the todo item that you want to remove. The function returns an array of `Todo` objects.

2. `todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id)`: This is the body of the `removeTodo` function. It calls the `filter` function on the `todos` array.

3. `(todo) => todo.id !== id`: This is the function provided to the `filter` method. It takes a todo item and returns `true` if the todo's `id` is not equal to the `id` passed to `removeTodo`, and `false` otherwise. This means that the `filter` method will create a new array that doesn't include the todo with the `id` passed to `removeTodo`.

In the Zustand store, the `removeTodo` function is used like this:

```typescript
removeTodo: (id: number) => set((state) => ({ todos: removeTodo(state.todos, id) })),
```

Here, `set` is a function provided by Zustand that allows you to update the state. It's called with a function that takes the current state and returns the new state. The new state is an object that includes the updated `todos` array, which is obtained by calling the `removeTodo` function with the current `todos` array and the `id` of the todo to remove.

In summary, the `removeTodo` function removes the todo with the specified `id` from the `todos` array, and the `removeTodo` method in the Zustand store updates the `todos` state with the new array.

harihargithub: want to import App.css

GitHub Copilot: To import a CSS file in a TypeScript React component, you can use the `import` statement at the top of your file. Here's how you can import `App.css`:

```typescript
import './App.css';
```

So, your updated code would look like this:

```typescriptreact
import './App.css';
import {
  Checkbox,
  Typography,
  Grid,
  useTheme,
} from '@material-ui/core';
import App from '.'

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

interface TodoListItemsProps {
  todos: Todo[];
  removeTodo: (id: number) => void;
}

function TodoListItems({ todos, removeTodo }: TodoListItemsProps) {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <Grid
          container
          spacing={3}
          style={{
            paddingTop: '16px',
            backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
```

This will apply the styles defined in `App.css` to your `TodoListItems` component.

harihargithub: so in zustand is it that there is no requirement of useEffect?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. One of the benefits of using Zustand for state management in React is that it eliminates the need for the `useEffect` hook in many cases.

In traditional React state management with `useState` and `useEffect`, you often use `useEffect` to perform side effects when the state changes. For example, you might fetch data from an API when a component mounts, or save data when the state changes.

With Zustand, you can handle these side effects directly in your actions. When you call an action, you can perform the side effect and then update the state. This means you don't need to use `useEffect` to watch for state changes.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import create from 'zustand';

interface State {
  data: string;
  fetchData: () => void;
}

export const useStore = create<State>((set) => ({
  data: '',
  fetchData: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.text();
    set({ data });
  },
}));
```

In this example, the `fetchData` action fetches data from an API and then updates the `data` state. You can call this action in your component like this:

```typescriptreact
const { data, fetchData } = useStore();

React.useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [fetchData]);
```

In this case, you're still using `useEffect`, but only to call the action when the component mounts. You're not using `useEffect` to watch for state changes.
